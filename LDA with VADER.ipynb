It\\'s not to prove that your code works, it\\'s to ensure that future code changes won\\'t change behaviors they shouldn\\'t.\\n\\nThen should you trust your tests suite enough, you would be confident that you can make changes without breaking anything covered by the test suite.\\n\\nJust right there, the dynamic changes. Proving that your code works (especially after it\\'s done) is not fun, mostly because you know it work, it runs and the results are there. But protecting your work from others (and your future self) immediately feel more noble.\\n\\nSecond if you do test, but after the code is done, here are a few disadvantage that you probably noticed:\\n\\n* Not so fun, you know it work (see above)\\n* Code might not be testable\\n* Refactoring to make it testable seems\\n   * risky since there are no tests to prove you won\\'t break anything (lack of confidence)\\n      * As a matter of fact : How many time have you heard \"it works now don\\'t touch anything\"\\n   * futile since you know it work and you might then decide to not tests everything and that leaves holes in the tests suite, reducing the trust in it.\\n* If you tried to make it testable from the start there are probably way to much interface and abstractions. And you might end up in mocking hell.\\n* Tests done after are often more akin to characterization tests, that is they explain what the implementation does instead of how is should behave.\\n* could go on...\\n\\nAs for test first:\\n\\n* More fun, kinda like a game, make a test, make it pass, high five peers\\n* Code is testable by default\\n* Refactoring is easier, if you break anything you know immediately\\n* When done correctly interfaces and abstractions are mostly limited to architectural boundaries.\\n* Test suite represent the specs of the project (how is should behave)\\n   * A project can be recreated from it\\'s spec alone, but the spec can\\'t be recreated from production code, at best you can characterize it, describe what it does not what it should do\\n* Little to no debugging. Everything worked a minute ago, finding the problem you created in the meantime should be pretty simple.\\n* It\\'s an iterative process, always ready to commit. It\\'s not all there, but every implemented spec is done and tested at all time, maybe it just handle the value \\'3\\', but if higher up want to deploy it now, they can\\n* could also go on...\\n\\nPerhaps you notice there is some kind of \"directionality\" to it, going from spec to behavior, from tests to code, that don\\'t work very well the other way around. This is where lie the strength of TDD I think.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to believe me, but I would invite you give it a try.\\n\\nOf course keep in mind it\\'s not a perfect technique and don\\'t think it aim to resolve every problems in the world, it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nJust know that like most programming technique, TDD requires some getting used to until it becomes more \"natural\". Usually a programmer would need to do it full time for about 4 to 6 month or part time consistently for about a year.\\n\\nAnd eventually you will have done all your mistakes and will then know what to do and not to do.\\n\\nUnfortunately, most people who try it don\\'t get there and often complain about things that usually resolve themselves once you get a better gist of it. There are also a lot of fan of TDD trying to explain it who are not there yet neither and end up making the technique look bad.\\n\\nA frequent mistake people make is to think you need a class of test for every class of production code. It\\'s wrong and only lead to fragile tests which is a frequent complain (\"tests breaks every time I make a change\"). Lots and lots of workplaces do it, but you can\\'t fulfill the purpose of automated tests if your tests break every time you rename or move a class or a method.\\n\\n\"A class of test for every class of production code\" come from books and blog posts whose examples are generally too simple. When all the examples you see always test a single class then it certainly looks like that\\'s what you should do. But actually that technique is more akin to micro-tests, which can be useful while working on a feature, but is mostly useless and unmaintainable in a test suite.\\n\\nProper unit tests would mostly focus on the inputs and outputs of the facade of your project, of the public entry points, while using test doubles for architectural boundaries (inputs and outputs include parameters and returned values, but also data getaways, which send data to or receive data from outside the architectural boundaries). Public entry points could still be a single class, say if you\\'re doing a math or a collection library, where almost everything would be public, but that is not the case of most libraries or apis where public entry points would be pretty limited.\\n\\nOk, since this is getting pretty long I\\'ll conclude with this. A successful test suite should act like a client to production code and be decoupled from it. Production code should be decoupled from it\\'s architectural boundaries. And if you have to remember only one thing it should be that as tests become more specific, the production code should become more generic (so they really can\\'t be 1:1), it should help render whatever the type of test you decide to make easier to maintain.\\n\\nHave a good one!', 'Find it weird that this sub will be on your case for not strictly typing every single function but has a problem with the idea of TDD. Never heard of tests as documentation?', \"To be fair, you can't enforce TDD unless you expect someone to write tests, make a PR, get it approved and merge it, before developing.\\n\\nWhy can't you enforce it? Because when you make a PR, your tests are present. If you don't fk it up and make separate commits for test and implementation and clearly show your tests were written after the fact, then no one will know.\\n\\nIt's amazing. Also TDD done right is actually not very developer friendly, we aren't machines.\", 'Yup', 'False, all false', \"Actually when I tried this for fun I kinda liked it... But maybe it's not good for real world projects.\", \"It's always interesting to me that they people we respect in an industry that push certain ideas and ways of doing things are also largely not actively doing that any more, but are more so just influencers in the tech space. They write books, talk at conferences, and host youtube channels about software, but they don't actively create software anymore.\", \"I just talked with some guys that took TDD way too seriously. It's more dogma than anything anymore.\", \"TDD is (in my opinion) an over-correction that was popularized when writing automated tests was relatively rare.\\n\\nI've been on a few teams that have tried to implement actual TDD and it just never goes well. In order for TDD to even be possible, you have to have your entire interface planned out before you write a single line of code, which just isn't how most human beings write software.\\n\\nIn my experience (and this varies from person to person) the SWE process goes something like this\\n\\n1. Define requirements, coordinate w/ stakeholders to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding user stories and whatnot\\n2. High level planning, figure out the gist of how the code should be laid out, what patterns you'll use, and how it'll fit in with the existing flows\\n3. Get it working, using the rough plan established in previous step, write something that fulfills the requirements without worrying **too** much about cleanliness and optimization. Quite often, you'll need to make some departure to your high level plan as you dig into the intracacies of the problem.\\n3. Clean it up, this is where you worry about cleanliness and optimization, take the functionality that you just wrote, but massage it into something readable, maintainable, and testable.\\n4. Write the tests, self explantory\\n\\nPutting the last step before step #2  means that you're basically locked into your initial plan. If you realize that the interface you initially designed and built your tests against isn't ideal, you'll either have to rewrite all your tests, or you'll have to figure out a way to continue using that interface, even if it's not ideal.\\n\\nAnd frankly I've never seen what the benefits could actually be, compared to defining your use-cases during requirements gathering, then building test cases surrounding those use-cases (and building unit tests for underlying low-level functionality that proves necessary during development).\\n\\ntl;dr TDD only sounds like a great idea if you've never actually tried to do it with an enterprise code-base\", '[removed]', \"1.

This is what you’re aiming for with TDD, a file tree full of screws and other tools with highly verified behavior that you can compose  as desired.

This is very useful when you have some actual logic, not just API calls.\\n\\n>To me that's like going through all the effort of testing without getting any of the benefits of it. Imagine trying to test something like a search engine like that - how on earth am I supposed to write tests to see if a website is working 100% properly just by sending requests to it? \\n\\nYou are confusing things here probably. You should test your own logic. If you call an API and with the response you have to do some logic, then you test only the logic with a fake api response. So you make sure that your logic is correct. If you just pass the information without any transformation then you so not need any test. And about the database, you own the db, you can startup a docker container and fill it with the data you need. No randomness here.\", 'It doesn’t matter how you describe a test that fails. That misses the point entirely.\\n\\nThe point is. TDD sucks because you have to write tests before you have an underlying implementation completed.

You don’t change the test when it’s not passing, you change the code. The only reason you would need to change the tests is if you need to change the overall architecture of the system, not the implementation of a particular method. Decide how it will work at a high level first, write tests for those high level expectations, then write the implementations that satisfy the tests. The tests only change if the high level expectations change, but those shouldn’t change very often. If you can’t nail down those high level expectations yet then sure do some prototyping, but once you go to start doing the real work then you switch to writing tests first. Your exploration is about figuring out how to build a testable system, not building the system and figuring out how to test it afterwards. Once you know how to build that testable system, you write the tests and then go back to filling in the implementation. That doesn’t suck, it saves your sanity by letting you be confident about the work you’ve done.', \"It's only slower before you've gotten used to it. Afterwards, it tends to go faster, because you're more sure that your code works as intended, and you discover and prevent more errors during development, rather than afterwards.\", 'You got any openings?', '> For instance the writing to a file or the connection to a dB. All I want is to say to the test - every time that you create e a new object that handles the connection to the db, just return true - I am not testing the connection to the db, I just want to test that the \"write to db\" was called with values A, B and C.\\n\\nI\\'d be asking myself \"how does the user of my app know when this function has completed?\" There exists a world where even changing the database used by the private methods didn\\'t break the tests, nor changing the interface of those methods, but that the database connection was still tested.  To do that you would need to test using the public interface for verification as well.  Detecting that a private method was called with certain arguments isn\\'t a resilient test. \"When I save these changes to a user, the next time I look up the user by ID, those fields will be set.\"  \"When I attempt to save a valid user, I get a successful response containing the timestamp at which the user was updated.\"  These are tests you could write against a library or API that would survive the user storage backend being completely recreated, all private methods being renamed, and yet still verify the functionality of your app.  You don\\'t need to stub the method that writes to the database, or aka dependency inject a mock database service implementing the DB interface in some languages, you just need a local test database to use for your tests.  I use `docker compose` at work to make it super easy to set these up in both development and CI pipelines.', 'Do you have any tricks for having tons of tests that all hit the database without them walking over each other?\\n\\nIE maybe you have tests that involve creating/deleting individual rows in a table, and another test that performs an aggregate on that table. Tests running concurrently will interfere with each other, and running tests sequentially is slooow', \"Well on the bright side you will have fewer tests doing this. But they will be a *lot* slower hitting even a local DB, especially if you have a complicated schema and any test might end up creating many objects, associations, and transitive associations in just a few lines of factory code.  Where I work we have even slower integration tests that have to provision resources on a remote kubernetes cluster in order to succeed, now those are slow.  But I do think they've saved time in the long run!\\n\\nYou can still run concurrent tests against a DB, there are just gotchas associated with that.  One way, with an RDBMS and depending on how you provision connections, you could start a transaction before each test and roll it back at the end - other transactions wouldn't be able to see the deletes etc. until it's applied.\\n\\nOf course you'll never get to use this with a NoSQL DB (or many ORMs, or if your methods make use of transactions themselves), then you have to ensure your test data doesn't collide by naming things differently (factories can make this not too hard).  When you're aggregating a column you filter on the data you created for that test.\\n\\nBut it's definitely a cost of this approach that even with fewer tests, they'll probably run a lot slower than if you explicitly mock all dependencies.  Using factories like I'm recommending compounds this way further than fixtures (preexisting/seeded test resources that you verify API calls with) since certain branches will be called repeatedly in test after test just in creating and recreating the test data.  IMO the clarity of factories vs fixtures is worth it, and the time saved refactoring tests is as well.  Normally only the CI runs the full test suite unless someone is making some major changes.\"] \n",

The unit tests are a side effect of TDD.,TDD is neat for doing bugfixes, but generally clunky. People who make TDD articles/posts/whatever are the worst though.,I love doing TDD so long as it\\'s not frontend TDD.,Most places use TDD: Ticket Driven Development.,Man, I\\'m gonna get backlash for this. But in my opinion, this is how you spot an excellent developer. One who uses TDD without making a big deal out of it and always has fitting tests and finishes his features with a good test coverage.,The 4 steps for good TDD:\\n1. Goto 3\\n2. Write test\\n3. Write code\\n4. Push it to production,People don\\'t like tdd because it makes you think beforehand which is harder than just writing code yolo style (and also because normally nobody likes to write tests).\\n\\nI don\\'t follow tdd strictly but always apply it somehow (write something first until I have everything figured out in my head, write tests as if they were the consumers/users of the new code, and write the rest of the code),If you build something than needs long term maintenance, refactoring and extension, hate it or not, it\\'s your best option.,Anyone who says they hate Test-Driven Development doesn\\'t take into account the fact that all development is test-driven.

If TDD helps you write good code, do it, if not, leave it.,Did it once for a project a couple of years ago. I was writing an emulator for a microprocessor and had to implement a bunch of instructions. I would usually write a test first. Setup the memory and some registers, put the opcode for the instruction I was working on into memory and make the program counter point to it. Then implement the actual instruction. \\n\\nI think it worked pretty well and made a lot of sense in this case, because the instructions were fairly self contained and separateley testable. But I\\'d hate to do it with more complex, monolithic projects.,I fucking love TDD tbh. It\\'s not useful in the slightest in a vast majority of situations, but when you have a situation where TDD is useful, it makes debugging so effortless I get tears in my eyes.,I had the chance only once to work in TDD. One time I spent 3 days wriring the test cases and the actual implementation took a single hour. It was really satifying to run the tests and all of them passing at once.,Some interesting blogs about Ron Jeffries tried to use TDD to write a sudoku solver:\\n\\nhttps://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/sudokumusings/  \\nhttps://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/oksudoku/  \\nhttps://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/sudoku2/  \\nhttps://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/sudoku4/  \\nhttps://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/sudoku5/  \\n\\nAnd his latest vent about his failure on it:\\n\\nhttps://ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/01121/sudoku-again/\\n\\nTruth be told, TDD won\\'t magically solve a problem if you don\\'t know how to solve it in the first place.,It looks like some sort of dark ritual where we please Sonar with code coverage written by our own blood...,I write my tests before I even know what the requirements are.,I remember TDD became a big thing back when Ruby on Rails was in its heyday. One of the big drawbacks of RoR was that it was one of those wishy-washy dynamically-typed hippy languages where you were never quite sure what kind of object you were dealing with. This made it fun to write but nightmarish to debug, especially on larger teams. Most of the tests written for RoR projects would have been superfluous in a typed language.,IDK…\\n\\nWe’re more of a BDD or BDSM sub,Well done, you made me chuckle,TDD has some major advantages and can be super useful.\\n\\nHaving said that, I hate TDD.,What does this meme template mean??

Requirements?  who’s ever heard of those.,I do TDD when changing code - but net new it’s too hard, things change so much during dev,I have had the occasional ticket that writing the tests first actually made sense, and it\\'s almost always algorithmic requirements. I mean we\\'re talking 1 in a 1000, but it was satisfying to just work through passing each test like they do in the lessons.,TDD is useful if you work for a government agency and what you’re building has a very clear spec already.. otherwise it’s a pedantic waste of time.,Test driven architecture / api design is great\\n\\nTest driven development is a silly concept made up by academics who never had to write production code,The one thing that I did take to heart about TDD is to write some or all of the tests as you write the code instead of writing all the tests after. It spreads out the pain of writing tests and lets you kinda lock in a subset of the behaviour that you’re trying to implement before you move on to the next step. But straight-up TDD workflows are total fantasies and no amount of Uncle Bob videos can convince me otherwise,I like it.  I don’t always use it but it has taught me to write testable code.,TDD is only good in college.,Ahhh, TDD: the great hoax of this generation of developers.,A few things here:\\n\\nFirst what is the purpose of automated tests (unit or otherwise)? It\\'s not to prove that your code works, it\\'s to ensure that future code changes won\\'t change behaviors they shouldn\\'t.\\n\\nThen should you trust your tests suite enough, you would be confident that you can make changes without breaking anything covered by the test suite.\\n\\nJust right there, the dynamic changes. Proving that your code works (especially after it\\'s done) is not fun, mostly because you know it work, it runs and the results are there. But protecting your work from others (and your future self) immediately feel more noble.\\n\\nSecond if you do test, but after the code is done, here are a few disadvantage that you probably noticed:\\n\\n* Not so fun, you know it work (see above)\\n* Code might not be testable\\n* Refactoring to make it testable seems\\n   * risky since there are no tests to prove you won\\'t break anything (lack of confidence)\\n      * As a matter of fact : How many time have you heard \"it works now don\\'t touch anything\"\\n   * futile since you know it work and you might then decide to not tests everything and that leaves holes in the tests suite, reducing the trust in it.\\n* If you tried to make it testable from the start there are probably way to much interface and abstractions. And you might end up in mocking hell.\\n* Tests done after are often more akin to characterization tests, that is they explain what the implementation does instead of how is should behave.\\n* could go on...\\n\\nAs for test first:\\n\\n* More fun, kinda like a game, make a test, make it pass, high five peers\\n* Code is testable by default\\n* Refactoring is easier, if you break anything you know immediately\\n* When done correctly interfaces and abstractions are mostly limited to architectural boundaries.\\n* Test suite represent the specs of the project (how is should behave)\\n   * A project can be recreated from it\\'s spec alone, but the spec can\\'t be recreated from production code, at best you can characterize it, describe what it does not what it should do\\n* Little to no debugging. Everything worked a minute ago, finding the problem you created in the meantime should be pretty simple.\\n* It\\'s an iterative process, always ready to commit. It\\'s not all there, but every implemented spec is done and tested at all time, maybe it just handle the value \\'3\\', but if higher up want to deploy it now, they can\\n* could also go on...\\n\\nPerhaps you notice there is some kind of \"directionality\" to it, going from spec to behavior, from tests to code, that don\\'t work very well the other way around. This is where lie the strength of TDD I think.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to believe me, but I would invite you give it a try.\\n\\nOf course keep in mind it\\'s not a perfect technique and don\\'t think it aim to resolve every problems in the world, it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nJust know that like most programming technique, TDD requires some getting used to until it becomes more \"natural\". Usually a programmer would need to do it full time for about 4 to 6 month or part time consistently for about a year.\\n\\nAnd eventually you will have done all your mistakes and will then know what to do and not to do.\\n\\nUnfortunately, most people who try it don\\'t get there and often complain about things that usually resolve themselves once you get a better gist of it. There are also a lot of fan of TDD trying to explain it who are not there yet neither and end up making the technique look bad.\\n\\nA frequent mistake people make is to think you need a class of test for every class of production code. It\\'s wrong and only lead to fragile tests which is a frequent complain (\"tests breaks every time I make a change\"). Lots and lots of workplaces do it, but you can\\'t fulfill the purpose of automated tests if your tests break every time you rename or move a class or a method.\\n\\n\"A class of test for every class of production code\" come from books and blog posts whose examples are generally too simple. When all the examples you see always test a single class then it certainly looks like that\\'s what you should do. But actually that technique is more akin to micro-tests, which can be useful while working on a feature, but is mostly useless and unmaintainable in a test suite.\\n\\nProper unit tests would mostly focus on the inputs and outputs of the facade of your project, of the public entry points, while using test doubles for architectural boundaries (inputs and outputs include parameters and returned values, but also data getaways, which send data to or receive data from outside the architectural boundaries). Public entry points could still be a single class, say if you\\'re doing a math or a collection library, where almost everything would be public, but that is not the case of most libraries or apis where public entry points would be pretty limited.\\n\\nOk, since this is getting pretty long I\\'ll conclude with this. A successful test suite should act like a client to production code and be decoupled from it. Production code should be decoupled from it\\'s architectural boundaries. And if you have to remember only one thing it should be that as tests become more specific, the production code should become more generic (so they really can\\'t be 1:1), it should help render whatever the type of test you decide to make easier to maintain.\\n\\nHave a good one!,Find it weird that this sub will be on your case for not strictly typing every single function but has a problem with the idea of TDD. Never heard of tests as documentation?,To be fair, you can\\'t enforce TDD unless you expect someone to write tests, make a PR, get it approved and merge it, before developing.\\n\\nWhy can\\'t you enforce it? Because when you make a PR, your tests are present. If you don\\'t fk it up and make separate commits for test and implementation and clearly show your tests were written after the fact, then no one will know.\\n\\nIt\\'s amazing. Also TDD done right is actually not very developer friendly, we aren\\'t machines.,Yup,False, all false,Actually when I tried this for fun I kinda liked it... But maybe it\\'s not good for real world projects.,It\\'s always interesting to me that they people we respect in an industry that push certain ideas and ways of doing things are also largely not actively doing that any more, but are more so just influencers in the tech space. They write books, talk at conferences, and host youtube channels about software, but they don\\'t actively create software anymore.,I just talked with some guys that took TDD way too seriously. It\\'s more dogma than anything anymore.,TDD is (in my opinion) an over-correction that was popularized when writing automated tests was relatively rare.\\n\\nI\\'ve been on a few teams that have tried to implement actual TDD and it just never goes well. In order for TDD to even be possible, you have to have your entire interface planned out before you write a single line of code, which just isn\\'t how most human beings write software.\\n\\nIn my experience (and this varies from person to person) the SWE process goes something like this\\n\\n1. Define requirements, coordinate w/ stakeholders to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding user stories and whatnot\\n2. High level planning, figure out the gist of how the code should be laid out, what patterns you\\'ll use, and how it\\'ll fit in with the existing flows\\n3. Get it working, using the rough plan established in previous step, write something that fulfills the requirements without worrying **too** much about cleanliness and optimization. Quite often, you\\'ll need to make some departure to your high level plan as you dig into the intracacies of the problem.\\n3. Clean it up, this is where you worry about cleanliness and optimization, take the functionality that you just wrote, but massage it into something readable, maintainable, and testable.\\n4. Write the tests, self explantory\\n\\nPutting the last step before step #2  means that you\\'re basically locked into your initial plan. If you realize that the interface you initially designed and built your tests against isn\\'t ideal, you\\'ll either have to rewrite all your tests, or you\\'ll have to figure out a way to continue using that interface, even if it\\'s not ideal.\\n\\nAnd frankly I\\'ve never seen what the benefits could actually be, compared to defining your use-cases during requirements gathering, then building test cases surrounding those use-cases (and building unit tests for underlying low-level functionality that proves necessary during development).\\n\\ntl;dr TDD only sounds like a great idea if you\\'ve never actually tried to do it with an enterprise code-base,[removed],1. Make tests\\n\\n2. Make code\\n\\n3. Use tests to review the code, tests fail\\n\\n4. Manually review code, it looks perfectly fine\\n\\n5. Try to fix tests, keep failing\\n\\n6.

If there is a bug that relates to a specific enough situation that I can write a unit test for it, that\\'s the first thing I do. \\n\\nThe next thing I do is write some unit tests that do not directly involve the bug scenario, but are adjacent to it -- these tests should pass before I start writing the fix.

As Obi Wan said, “only a Sith deals in absolutes”…,I love TDD, where am I on the bell curve?,I’ve found that the best order is PROTOTYPE -> TDD \\n\\nbasically, you build a proof of concept that accomplishes bare bones. Then build tests based on the correct answer of the prototype. Then, build your refined model with TDD.\\n\\nTest driven dev only really works if you know what you want the outcome to be, but sometimes that changes as you build. This is why a basic prototype is the foundation for good TDD since you have an idea to test against,Doctests make TDD a whole lot simpler.\\n\\nI don\\'t even know if I could call doctests TDD though, you don\\'t build the test before the code. The tests and the code are developed simultaneously. It doesn\\'t matter which one comes first; what\\'s more important is you only work in a single file and the first few tests are tightly coupled with the code.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t even need to be a robust test, it just needs to get you an entrypoint into the function and smoke test at least one case.\\n\\nWay too few people use doctests (it doesn\\'t help that ruby rouge doesn\\'t syntax highlight them).,BDD?,For bigger features composed of multiple modules, TDD is a godsend. \\n\\nImagine you’re building a feature composed of three sections, and it takes you about one month per section. I’m talking 10+ new components, new api endpoint, new page, new errors to handle, new types etc.\\n\\nOn month 3 there might be something you need to change from work you’ve done on month 1, because at the time you did not anticipate such a requirement and that’s where it becomes dangerously easy to break stuff.\\n\\nWrite your tests as you go or you’ll be spending more time debugging and trying everything manually down the line.\\n\\nAlso tests help you structure code better as you go, because you’re developing easy to test components. It also makes reviews easier.,I wonder how many people here are thinking TDD = writing unit tests? Integration tests and even manual testing can be great TDD too! For me, TDD is all about writing code with the code giving you feedback about how you’re doing. “Self testing code” is probably a way better name for it.,I love automatic testing tbh. You change something and break something you didn\\'t think would be affected and the test immediately show it to you,cries in almost untestable application, because lack of dependency injection,Stop tdd memes😂😂,When I use it is highly dependent on what I\\'m doing. If I\\'m making something with known inputs and outputs, it\\'s amazing. Something like a desearalizer, USB data, checksum verification, whathaveyou.\\n\\nIf I\\'m interpreting a file and doing visualizations I will just either do it manually or make a script, or if I\\'m working on a UI I just do FAFO development (fuck around and find out).\\n\\nGranted all dev is test driven, it\\'s just when and how you test and the preference to not have it done on main.,Pfft. I once wrote 500 lines of code without testing throughout. It ran with only a handful of logic and compile errors. Proper knowledge of how to use a debugger is the only thing one needs. Worry about edge cases as they present themselves.,He developed ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯,TDD is good for components like Repos or validators but it seems impossible to do with a higher level service that coordinates those items. my guess is TDD wouldn\\'t cover the higher level service. i tend to do London School testing (aka mockist) so i will test the higer services with mocks of the repos, validators etc.,TDD only works if you have strong requirements defined up front and have a good idea of your technical design up front. Otherwise you are just wasting your time.,Here it is 2023, and a lengthy thread about TDD on Reddit is still talking about tests rather than design,TDD would be great if I could write a proper test that isn\\'t busted for the wrong reason xD,I love red, in my first job as a junior you needed to run all tests before committing so i changed the colour of a button, ran the tests and went to get a coffee,Every place I worked at has done tests after dev. Still to find anywhere with the time and patience to do it \"right\",Confused fry meme:\\n\\n\"Not sure what I should be working on\"\\n\\n\"So I will just write tests\",How can you finish development without ever running the code? Personally, I generally write a bunch of code, but need to run it at least a few times to get it working. I don\\'t mean getting the bugs out, I mean just running at all. Writing a test script is how I get the code to even run.,JIT is the way.,And then give  it to the testers.,I do pure TDD. I code faster than most and my code has zero defects. Developing without tests is like walking a tightrope without a net.\\n\\nI have also mentored and taught countless others to do the same. You probably have not been taught it correctly.\\n\\nOf note: TDD works best if you have a refactoring browser (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc) and a pure OO language so that you can refactor and perfect the design as you go (Just in time design or JID). I still use unit tests in clojure, Python, etc., but don\\'t do TDD.,[removed],How do they test the Test development?,I sometimes do TDD on accident where basically I add a feature, not intended to break anything, so I write a bunch of tests and keep the existing tests around and then I just keep fiddling with my code until they all pass - old and new ones alike.\\n\\nThat\\'s TDD. I don\\'t always do it, but when I do I don\\'t even consciously notice. Sometimes it just feels easier to specify what you want than it is to code it. Recent example was when I wanted to detect loops that would make a topological sort impossible. There\\'s an algorithm ready-made out there, yes, but it felt easier to specify what should happen than it was to implement the algorithm efficiently.\\n\\nMost of the time it isn\\'t easier though... and when it isn\\'t TDD can be a real impediment.,This is the answer!,So... DDT?,That would be Development Driven Test,happy cake day man,DDTDD,Writing tests first is just unrealistic in most environments. Unless you know 100% in detail how everything is supposed to work. But often you need to figure out how to handle all the edge cases on the fly. There\\'s a very small space between \"so trivial it doesn\\'t need test\" and \"simple enough to fully specify in advance\" where TDD shines.\\n\\nUnless of course you\\'re working with an interpreted language. In that case tough luck. Tests are the only good static validation you\\'ll get. A lot of manual labor just to replace some nice types...,To ruin lives of future guys working with the code! 😁,My man!,r/sarcasm,To be honest it always sounded awful to me - you\\'re about as likely to make mistakes designing the tests as you are to make mistakes while coding, and more importantly than that, you don\\'t always know exactly what every function in your code is supposed to do before you start coding - usually while you\\'re coding you\\'ll realize that there are ways it could\\'ve been done better by rearranging the code, but if you want to rearrange the code then you have to rewrite all the tests too.\\n\\n\\n.. Well, there\\'s also the 3rd problem which is that the only way to truly test every case is to *literally* test every case (so if a function takes an int32 as a parameter, then you have to test all 2^32 cases), which would obviously take forever to do and would be completely stupid. If your only goal is to pass the test cases then it\\'s really easy to come up with dumb code that technically passes it but doesn\\'t actually do what it\\'s supposed to still.,It\\'s exactly the way it works,This seems smart. \\n\\nI did some time in medical side. It was basically TDD-style they just didn\\'t know it. It was also waterfall and very conservative.\\n\\nNow I\\'m doing zero tests -style, they just don\\'t admit it. It\\'s also agile and very chaotic. \\n\\nLatter is better for my wellbeing,This is the way. If I already have a clear idea of the implementation then I can just knock it out and when I write tests for it really won\\'t matter. If I\\'m not clear on the implementation then I\\'ll start by writing some simple tests and drill down from there,Best way to use it for me as well.  \\nNew feature to implement, not sure what patterns/architecture I\\'ll implement? Start with a basic unit test of the surface methods (e.g. a controller\\'s action) and make it pass. That will help me figure out the interface of whatever dependency that action will need. Then make a test for that interface, and implement that. Rinse and repeat until you run out of dependencies.,Using TDD when I need it and it’ll actually save time is how I do it too\\n\\nIf a problem is complex enough, running tests manually would take too much time or I’ll be writing tests for it anyway because there is realistically time to do so then I will 100% use TDD.\\n\\nIt gives so much peace of mind for refactoring code when you know you can just click a button and test all the needed cases in an instant,That sounds... Like a really good idea that I need to incorporate into my tool set,It\\'s also (supposedly) a good way to get decent work out of junior devs. Setup the project, write up the core unit tests, pass it to a junior after a few hours of code review.,Well that\\'s the thing, what if you don\\'t get writer\\'s block without TDD?,I use for opening volleys with large tickets, quickly create a running prototype then, send screenshot of the “should list” to stake holders and they find and fill the gaps for me, really slick.,4. Change the code to make it work in production.  \\n\\n5. GOTO 3,1. Write tests\\n2. Write method\\n3. Need different inputs\\n4. Fix test\\n5. Fix method\\n6. Need to extract logic to new method\\n7. Write test B\\n8. Fix test A\\n9. Fix method A\\n10. Lose thought process\\n11. Delete everything\\n12. Go to step 1,Good old DDT,You got the spirit at least.,I realize this is tongue-in-cheek (hope?), but the tests are supposed to be written from requirements - they ensure the requirements are met by the code.\\n\\nUnless the requirements change, there is no need for tests to ever be touched once written.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there are so few places that require good requirements.  Most just leave it to the developer to figure out from bug reports.,Wait a damn minute. That\\'s illegal!,I actually do it like this but on purpose.\\n\\nI have unit tests where I run my code on an input and then compare the output to a known, good output (often called the \"golden\" output). I add new inputs and golden outputs all the time.\\n\\nSo I\\'ll make one commit to add a test+golden that demonstrates the problem, without modifying any code. And then another commit which fixes the code. In the second commit you can see the code change and also how it affected the golden file.\\n\\nIf all this were one commit then it wouldn\\'t be clear what effect the new code is having. Doing it like I do makes it clear how the code is affecting the functionality.\\n\\n**tldr: This but unironically.**,That\\'s why the development time of adding tests *should* be included by default. For example, if it takes 2 hours to build this feature, and 3 hours to add tests, it takes 5 hours the build the feature,I have never saved times by skipping tests. Cuz your testing anyway. Question is if you do it manually every time or with the click of a button.,We\\'re currently doing Scaled Agile Framework, where 1 story point is half a day of coding, half a day of testing.\\n\\nBut I\\'m a software tester, so management essentially goes \"unit tests? never heard of her\" for my automation,It\\'s the stakeholders\\' deadline, not mine.,Seems like the more reasonable approach apart from some essential stuff or when something 100% 4 sure can\\'t go wrong,\\n\\nBiggest gripe I have with TDD is that in order for it to be useful it\\'ll absolutely have to pass if it works and absolutely fail if it doesn\\'t, writing the correct tests and all edge-cases in order to ensure that can sometimes be extremely hard to do or even impossible. \\n\\nIf your writing code that gets all 10 passes and you\\'ve done a bad implementation you can still write code that fail to function for a week every few years or so cause you hard-coded that all years have 52 weeks. I mean why would anyone reasonable write a test for that edge-case?\\n\\nValidation of a function is done by the guys who are writing/reviewing the code. Sure those people can use TDD in order to validate their solution instead of having to manually type In a bunch of stuff everytime, but the moment someone else starts reworking the code they\\'ll have to review the tests to see if they have to implement new tests for however they are refactoring that part.,Lmao, would that be testing the CSS, the onhover, the click, the fact that it renders, the fact that it doesn\\'t 404,  umm.. can\\'t think of 3 more. What else would you test?,That\\'s actually great. Two hours isn\\'t that much for a test-covered feature. And sure, it\\'s just a link, but tell that to the yesterday\\'s me who spent quite some time looking for a way around a broken link on a **$250-fucking-billion** company\\'s website only to end up on page filled with lorem ipsum.,Every tool is not needed for every problem. There is so much of this \\n\\nPerson One: \"I got a thing that works really good for this use case\"\\n\\nThe Internet: \"Everyone should do this for everything for always!\",At it\\'s best it allows sub par programmers to do extremely simple things.\\n\\nAt it\\'s worst it merely satisfies managements desire to see checkboxes marked.,Introduce me to these people, they probably know what they are doing more than you do.,But god dammit that was the best hyperlink I\\'ve ever seen,That hyperlink sits on the shoulders of giants.,This. It\\'s an excellent way to find and fix bugs.,Youre not supposed to test for structure, youre supposed to test for behavior,Because people aren\\'t used to writing the style of code that TDD works well with, and are often forced to use it with code that doesn\\'t work well in that style (highly imperative code, often with high coupling, mostly).\\n\\nSome studies done with TDD have shown that a lot of the benefits of it are maintained even when the people *aren\\'t using TDD*.  IOW, TDD is a forcing function that forces you to write modular, isolated, testable code, and once you\\'ve learned it, those design principles carry over.,This 100%. I don\\'t get the hate. My guess is that those hating on it are probably doing it wrong.,Reading the other comments here…most people have no idea what TDD actually is.,It\\'s pretty sad how far I had to scroll to find this comment.,What is “generally clunky” about it? IMO using it for a bug fix is extremely clunky unless TDD is followed generally, because you can definitely write code that works but is hard to test. Suddenly you’re trying to track down a bug and stubbing so many things you don’t know what’s real or fake and you realize it’s because you designed the interfaces terribly, not because TDD sucks. If you’re hating TDD it’s likely because you’re crossing the boundaries of interfaces in your tests and re-testing code that is already tested somewhere else (or even worse, is never tested). It should be concise and logical when done right, with a minimal amount of stubbing. When you’re stubbing a ton, I would check to see if you have some untested code, or if you have not separated concerns appropriately in your design.,People who make articles/posts/whatever are the worst, regardless of context.,Everyone \"uses\" TDD for bugfixes even if they don\\'t realize it:\\n\\n* Reproduce bug\\n* Change stuff\\n* Try to reproduce bug\\n  * No longer an issue? eof\\n  * Still happening?, go to 1,We\\'re doing ACDD - Acceptance Criteria Driven Development - and we love it. Both our frontend developers and our testers.,Big this, maybe front end is where all the TDD haters come from. Still some value but much more frivolous in some ways as well. I would never not write tests for back-end code though, just wouldn’t feel right.,Upgrade it to ACDD: Acceptance Criteria Driven Development,And 100% code coverage is not good coverage! Rapidly diminishing returns past 80%.,I now know I am a decent developer and a horrible sysadmin.,…or the end users.,Most people are older than 5, no? So most people would enjoy their vegetables.,Maybe I\\'m in the 50th percentile, but I also started to actually enjoy it. I used to often have otherwise some local run setup, temporary main functions or ipython session to test out stuff while I develop. But then I realized unit test can be exactly that. I am developing and testing same time and it leaves coverage behind as a side effect.\\n\\nHelps with design process as well. Even if I don’t have a clear idea, I’ll make a rough “E2E” test that uses the higher level interfaces and start ironing out details from there. Writing new tests as the need for new functions arise. \\n\\nAbsolutely necessary with refactoring unknown code. Write a test to a higher level function, while trying to making sense of it. Once it passes it adds confidence to make changes in lower levels.,I love it for home coding. Makes you plan ahead. Come back to a project a year later, and have the confidence to change anything you want because you have 100% coverage and 100% passed tests last time you checked it in. Not sure what some code is for? Take a look at the test.,REPL driven dev is still TDD, because to build something in a REPL you still need to know what you’re aiming for. \\nWhy not just write that as the assertion of a test, put the test into watch mode and then do the dev until the test passes? No more copy paste,tests are the way you determine completeness.,This is what happens when the peak of the bell curve makes memes.,This is good advice,TDD works for some styles of coding.  I think anybody can use TDD, but I think if you write code that doesn\\'t work with TDD, it\\'s not going to work for you.\\n\\nAt that point, you have to be willing to go through the learning curve to write that style of code, if you care.,Do you also happen to write the best code alone in the basement?,That works great until the colleague that only manually tested his code pushes a massive regression to production that he missed cuz the part of the code he wrote wasn\\'t covered by any tests.,I agree with the sentiment, but I think in certain cases it is almost unacceptable to not use TDD. Professional situations being one, and open source projects being another. The primary reason that communication between developers and a shared understanding of the interfaces available is key to success in these situations. In this case tests are a contract about application behavior that declare to other devs how the application should behave. All the devs involved need to agree about how the application should behave in a given situation, and test cases are great way to codify that. Then we don’t need a shared understanding of the entire application, we just need to agree that the tests must pass before we can merge or deploy. That way you can write your feature and I can write mine, and if we ever need to work on one another’s down the line we can be confident that we won’t break it because we will ensure it still passes the tests the other wrote to define its behavior. In such a case it’s not about how the individual works best but how the organization as a whole can work collectively, which might include some individuals working sub-optimally to adhere to the agreed upon standard.,if your project is too monolithic to do tdd you project is built wrong,[deleted],I usually spend more time writing tests than writing implementations, but that’s a pretty large disparity. Still, don’t discount the fact that writing tests often helps you think about the implementation as you go through the exercise.,But not using TDD doesn’t make you any more able to solve it either. If you can’t write the tests you don’t know how it works, simple as that. If you don’t how it works then you’re not likely to solve the problem in a holistic way. Maybe if you don’t do TDD you’re more likely to produce a buggy version that you think works but just hasn’t been thoroughly tested enough to show the flaws? But you still got it released so yay?\\n\\nBut to say that you’re more likely to produce correct software without TDD than with it seems a bit far fetched.,Isn\\'t the point to ensure that your code follows the requirements?,I’m a rails dev now and I strongly agree 😂 Not that I wouldn’t do TDD in a strongly typed language, but once you’ve debugged a sufficiently large rails app you see some strange bugs and start writing some tests that look more like prayers than assertions.,TDD has never been taught at university. It was created by practitioners.,It can be used in real world projects but the challenge is to eliminate side effects such as IO, whether it be UIs or the network or whatever. One has to build an architecture where any business logic is decoupled from that - and that is often not happening in real world projects.\\n\\nEspecially those that start out as as quickfix or temporary solution.,\"Get it working\" is carrying a lot of weight in that statement, and that\\'s where i think you misunderstand the value prop of TDD.\\n\\nHow exactly are you \"getting it working\"?\\n- pasting code into repl\\n- running a script by hand\\n- refreshing a web browser...?\\n\\nAll of those things done by hand are \"tests\", and you\\'re asserting that the current iteration of your code \"works\" by evaluating it with your eyes.\\n\\nNow imagine the same thing, but instead of you running the code (via repl, script, or browser refresh), your test suite runs the code.\\n\\nSame development cadence and everything. Bam, TDD.\\n\\nOn the point about being locked in by design patterns, nothing could be further from the truth. Once you have working tests, it FREES you to make wild-ass changes to the codebase under coverage, because you know the failing tests will point out what needs updating.\\n\\nTook 10+ yrs to finally dawn on me (I\\'m an OG scrappy cowboy coder ex-sysadmin) but jeeeesus i wish I could have convinced younger me to adopt it sooner.,It sounds like you have more experience than me, but in my limited time practicing TDD I couldn’t disagree more. In my experience the cost of rewriting tests as requirements change hasn’t been nearly as high as the benefit of planning out modular testable interfaces from the get-go. If I do try to code first and test later, then I end up writing heavily coupled code that isn’t modular enough for sensible unit testing.\\n\\nIn practicality I do a small amount of coding first, but try to get tests written as early in the process as I can. The faster I can get tests down, the sooner I can start picturing things in terms of well-defined single responsibility classes and methods, which means I have the architecture I want once all the implementation is complete.,I thought this way for a while. I find they really help if I do them right. Working from the most simple case to each edge case in the function helps me think simply and iteratively building each test for a new set of expected outputs then changing the function accordingly. \\n\\nIf the function im working on is sufficiently complex, TDD saves me time.,No. You\\'re asked to do something, you give your estimate. Your estimate includes TDD, but they don\\'t need to know or care about that. You just do it. It\\'s not a separate thing you add to the code. It\\'s part of the development process. Too expensive? They need to reduce the requirements or increase the budget. Just like **every other project ever.**,That’s the joke.,How do you possibly know you’re going to write a several thousand line module if you don’t know what it will do? If you have nothing in mind to implement, you can’t possibly need several thousand lines to do it.\\n\\nWhat you probably mean is you haven’t spent time considering how your code will be consumed, but you’re going to have that problem whether you practice TDD or not, the only difference being that when you finish one way leaves you with a module that probably works and a  repeatable test suite you can run against future changes for confidence, and the other way only leaves you with a module that probably works.,Or people who work professionally on teams that have to pass QA gates. You know... noobs! /s,TDD feels verbose when done on a new project with little complexity, but that is the most important time to practice it so that you can start off on a good foot with loosely-coupled code that has a single clear responsibility. When you are working on an existing code base with no tests then it is like pulling teeth to stub every poorly designed interaction, and it makes you think “man, when I start a new project I am NOT doing this shit”, perpetuating the cycle.,Just break your app logic down into as fundamental pieces as the math you’re talking about and you will be able to see the test cases. You likely have coupled certain concerns that should not be, preventing you from finding these small atomic pieces of functionality that present themselves well for unit tests. \\n\\nYou need to write in a certain style to do TDD well, but when you get that style down then the test cases become self-evident. And don’t test things that aren’t your responsibility, that’s the other part. If you’re consuming it then it’s someone else’s responsibility to get right, just stub the interaction in your test and let them worrying about guaranteeing their implementation conforms to the agreed upon interface.,Good take, yeah it probably is.,That shrug failed miserably, oh well.,I found it useful if you\\'re rewriting a thing that already exists.   You make a shitload of tests first that the first thing passes, and then make sure the new thing also passes all the same tests.   The main difference is you know ahead of time what has to work so you don\\'t waste time dreaming up tests for things that never make it into the end result.,I had an offer from a place that said it took TDD seriously and strictly enforced it.\\n\\nI did not take the job.,Honestly TDD is a bit of a cult. If you write tests before or after as long as you write GOOD tests who cares. Every TDD dev I’ve met has proclaimed it as the best and only way to do things. \\n\\nTDD works for some people and not for others. There’s no right way to do this, the main goal is getting quality work done. We need to stop being so “this is the only way, and if you don’t follow it you’re bad” and just show possibilities and let people make their own choices.,I’ve worked at a place that actually did TDD (and pairing) for all production code. If you were just experimenting with something on the side to learn how to do it, that experiment didn’t go into production without being rewritten using TDD with a pair. \\n\\nThey only did behavioral testing that way though.  Ex. Tests to guarantee the intended behavior was being implemented. That lets you generally protect against regressions, which is most of the benefit of TDD without the burdensome parts. Mostly just unit tests with a few integration tests.,I’ve worked a few places that strictly TDD. It’s a good tool but most of the value is testable iterative incremental change to a system. Honestly if I’m not teaching I write my tests after a small change unless I’m stuck. \\n\\nUsing it to get junior developers to think about how to break the problem down into small steps is pretty valuable. Creates a good “break” in the process if they start to habitually ask “what’s my test” before making a code change.,The second professional job I had was at an extreme shop (TDD, pair programming, the works).  Best work environment I have ever experienced until a new VP wanted to make her mark on the company and destroyed it.\\n\\nThe work environment quickly became toxic and I moved on.  I have never enjoyed working anyplace as much as I did there.  We worked hard and got so much done with so little rework and hassle.  Everywhere else I have worked is just way too much busy work when not done in the most efficient order (tests first).,I’m a QA engineer, we are building a new product right now, and writing automated tests for something that is in active development fucking sucks. Get the thing done, then test it. It’s fucking excruciating to test half of a feature that will change next week. You can’t tell what’s a bug, what is not done, what is undecided, or what. If you are going to write a bunch of tests on a feature that is still being completed be prepared to pay people to spin their wheels a lot lol.,In my experience it takes less time overall to a fully working product using TDD, but there aren\\'t many cases where the solution is planned out enough to be able to write thorough tests in advance. You kinda need to know what the solution looks like in advance if you want to write unit tests for it. Sometimes that can happen with just a little whiteboarding and pseudocode, but at that point it \"feels\" easier to just start coding.,We try but usually tests don\\'t end up keeping pace, and more tests are written during verification phases. Plus, a lot of times the test drivers aren\\'t there yet until there\\'s a known design used in the application, since we have to emulate a lot of hardware stuff. It\\'s definitely a best practice code smell to not have that all in place first.,Pivotal Labs. TDD, along with pair programming, was like a religion there. I think they got acquired by VMWare and became Tanzu Labs. Not sure if they are still drinking the TDD Kool aid.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve worked at a large bank as a developer and had to do TDD / pair programming, there\\'s a good chance it was pivotal Labs coming in as consultants being the reason behind that stuff.\\n\\nI interviewed with them around 2018. Luckily they had you come in and work half a day with them. It was a hard no after I realized how much TDD and pair programming will consume my days there.,I see it like Calvin asking if he can ride his bicycle on the roof before asking if he can have a cookie.  People default to no tests, if writing good tests after the fact is the compromise, I’ll take it!,Realistically speaking, no investor is going to say \"aw ye, slow down on that development time. We don\\'t need an MVP as soon as possible, take your time and do it right\". That\\'s just not the world we live in. And as engineers, the ammo we have to advocate for early testing is pretty ineffective. \\n\\nGenerally speaking, most clients want a product rushed to market, and then spend the early adoption period resolving issues. And once things have quietened down, *then* we can do things \"more right\" when implementing more features.,That\\'s because so much of development is testing different approaches and designs before settling on a solution. With TDD you inevitably end up having to redesign and rewrite those tests because you changed your mind when you ran into some problems. So you end up wasting quite a bit of time.,Mine does it! :D,Nah, if you have a specification, like in a real specification, not some list of features that somebody though about today, than TDD is just great.\\n\\nBut I am still trying to find some workplace where people have time and patience to get a specification before they finish development. I have worked on places that officially did waterfall (yeah, some people even say that), and they didn\\'t work that way.,I used to work with a guy that always did TDD, and it worked really well for him. He always had a pretty good idea of what he was going to implement ahead of time and so was able to create the tests right from the get go. I don\\'t think it works for everybody though, certainly not me,You don\\'t look for a place that \"does it right\".\\n\\nYOU \"do it right\" and make everyone else look to you for guidance when you\\'ve got fewer bugs and better overall productivity.,I\\'ve done it on a few libraries where it really made sense. I hated it. Took all the surprise and adventure out of coding.,Because it’s useless.  Only team I ever personally saw “doing it right” never released a thing.,Seriously I haven\\'t found one yet. Most of the work I have seen, are just moving data around and GUI, which either didn\\'t do any thing substantial to test or there is no way to predict the implications. Writing test code to force certain GUI is not good either.,I’ve done it right a couple of times and it’s felt really good. But I often find my tests are wrong before I even start coding and that’s depressing,TDD is not just about running the code, it\\'s specifically:\\n\\n* Write a test that *fails*\\n* Write just enough code to make the test *pass*\\n* Refactor\\n\\nRinse and repeat.\\n\\nSo the more traditional:\\n\\n* Write \"all\" code first\\n* Write test cases/run the code\\n* Fix the things that doesn\\'t work\\n\\nIs not TDD, even though you have multiple unit tests,I just run in a debug session, usually helps me catch the output. Debug early/debug often.,JITT noice 👌,Manually,I really agree in general - the important lesson to take from TDD is that any time spent manually testing rather than writing/running automated tests is wasted. Because you will probably want those tests eventually, they don\\'t just prevent bugs now but also regressions.\\n\\nI think that sometimes when you\\'re implementing something you might realize that the interface you were planning on is inefficient in some way - \"This function actually also needs this data passed in because of this case I forgot about\" for example. From experience I know I\\'m more likely to notice this stuff while implementing.,>usually while you\\'re coding you\\'ll realize that there are ways it could\\'ve been done better by rearranging the code, but if you want to rearrange the code then you have to rewrite all the tests too.\\n\\nIf anything, it\\'s the opposite: having tests can give you confidence when you rearrange your code because you know that the new version has the same behavior as the old to an external user.\\n\\nIf you have to change your tests because you rearranged your code then your tests are wrong.\\n\\n>.. Well, there\\'s also the 3rd problem which is that the only way to truly test every case is to literally test every case (so if a function takes an int32 as a parameter, then you have to test all 232 cases), which would obviously take forever to do and would be completely stupid. If your only goal is to pass the test cases then it\\'s really easy to come up with dumb code that technically passes it but doesn\\'t actually do what it\\'s supposed to still.\\n\\nThat\\'s why the \"refactor\" step of red/green/refactor exists. After making each test go green, you are supposed to refactor your code to make it as simple as it can possibly be while still passing the tests. At some point, having a gigantic LUT containing inputs and outputs for each test case becomes more complex than just implementing a general solution.,>you\\'re about as likely to make mistakes designing the tests as you are to make mistakes while coding\\n\\nBut with TDD you get two chances to catch the mistake. First, the test has to fail because the implementation isn\\'t there, *then* it has to pass once you have the code. There is no guarantee, obviously, but the probability of mistakes is reduced.\\n\\n>usually while you\\'re coding you\\'ll realize that there are ways it could\\'ve been done better by rearranging the code\\n\\nWith TDD, this realization is supposed to happen even earlier. Specifically, when you go to write the test. The idea is you\\'re putting yourself in the shoes of the client of the code you\\'re writing and if the test code is tricky to write, that\\'s a hint that the design is off in some way.\\n\\n>If your only goal is to pass the test cases.\\n\\nThe goal should be to gain confidence that the code is doing what it is intended to do and when it changes, if something breaks, a test will pick it up.\\n\\n>you don\\'t always know exactly what every function in your code is supposed to do before you start coding\\n\\nI think \"exploratory\" type coding is fine and is a good argument against TDD, but I would argue with experience, this type of coding happens less and less. I would suggest giving it a shot once in a while, and if it doesn\\'t feel natural with time, don\\'t force it and go back to what works for you.,You\\'re take is wrong. Test and code means you have express the same thing twice in different ways. And only if they mirror each other does it pass. Only if you write the exact same bug twice can you miss it. It\\'s the double bookkeeping of programming.,If the test is code, then you\\'re just as likely to write a bad test as bad code. I actually caught a bug that I didn\\'t even realize was a bug, and re-wrote the test to support the bug. The problem is we can never be 100% sure our code works as expected in the real world, because no test can 100% match real world usage.   \\nIf you write tests properly, then you should be able to refactor more easily, however in reality I\\'ve found that refactoring always breaks something unexpected.,My favorite is when I realize the logic in the method is too large so I need to extract it to a new method or class so now my original tests are broke and I need to write new tests around the new method I’m *going to* implement before my original tests can be fixed because the original method now has a new dependency that I can’t define until I complete the new method and new tests.,>To be honest it always sounded awful to me - you\\'re about as likely to make mistakes designing the tests as you are to make mistakes while coding\\n\\nI\\'ve often found that to be a problem with the way you\\'ve written your tests. I recently encountered a few bugs that were ultimately caused by bad tests not testing what I thought they were testing and were making too many assumptions. They were in the style of:\\n\\n`assert(x.foo() == bar(x))`\\n\\nTurned out returning bar(x) was not the right thing to do in x.foo(), which would\\'ve been really obvious if the test had simply asserted that `x.foo().result == \"foo\"` and failed with the message that \"foo\" isn\\'t \"bar\".\\n\\nLesson being, don\\'t overengineer your test. They\\'re not supposed to be DRY.,TDD isn\\'t about 100% test coverage, it\\'s about specifying the behavior you want before you start implementing that behavior.,> and more importantly than that, you don\\'t always know exactly what every function in your code is supposed to do before you start coding\\n\\nTest the interfaces, not the internals. Makes the test structure itself much easier, and it completely avoids the issue where you have to match your test to your internal logic. If anything, that\\'s the exact opposite of how TDD is supposed to work. \\n\\nAnd if you find your interface is constantly changing and hard to test, well there\\'s a big red flag right there.,The most common reason I have heard to justify TDD is so that the code that gets written is even unit testable without refactoring.\\n\\nBut all that translates to in practice is dependency inversion.  If people stopped chanting TDD TDD TDD and just chanted DI DI DI, we would get the same benefits without all the pain and wasted time.,If you have to substantially rewrite your tests because of a refactor, you are not testing at the correct boundary point. You are probably writing implementation tests instead of unit tests. All testing should be from the entry point to the *unit* of code. In other words, from the point one human is interacting with a thing another human made. Generally, this is just one method.\\n\\nImplementation tests are generally overkill, and only useful for things like library development. For userland code, skip them. If you unit tests cover everything, your implementation will be tested as a side effect. This leaves flexibilty to refactor with little to no changes to tests.,Yeah, that happens if you don\\'t plan properly and just start mindlessly shitting out random functions. Also, it seems like you lack the ability to understand nuances. Of course, it\\'s impractical to test every single execution path in your software, but there are input values that are more probable to uncover bugs. If you test those first, the probability of uncovered bugs drops dramatically.,Have you tried implementing Kubernetes?,My issue is that I bash out the implementation and then when it comes time to write the test, I don\\'t know what to actually expect. And you can\\'t just copy what\\'s currently happening and call that the success case, because what if it\\'s wrong?,This is still useful because then SOMEONE has recorded SOMEWHERE what the hell this code is supposed to do.,Bingo. If I\\'m ever writing libraries where the detailed function and class  definitions are known with reliability, I\\'m writing laaaaame code that i probably should be using an existing library for.,Jokes aside, I find it\\'s often overlooked and useful to sometimes add tiny bits here & there occasionally to tests to match the resulting code.\\n\\nFor example if a requirement says \"do X to match A B C\", and you do that, but along the way find \"hey i can also do Y, so I\\'ll make it open to that extension in the future\" or little stuff like that--the stuff that comes to mind as you build it--it\\'s useful to occasionally just toss that in.  Or to use a crude example, the test case is \"matches 3 factors\", and instead you realize a better way to do it is to match a full key-value pair of data with optional extras for extensiblity.\\n\\nThere\\'s some projects where doing the bare minimum is appropriate, and some where gold plating is worth the extra thought.  Personally I find unit tests and TDD hit or miss.\\n\\nedit: snipped my own rambling,Not all requirements are known when coding starts. Some change always comes up,That’s the beauty of waterscrum. The person making the deadlines is completely divorced from the development process.,Or offshore QA is manually testing at a fraction of the cost so the company is still saving money,given that it was a demo, they probably went super overboard in the granularity of their tests, and so \"testing the CSS\" could easily comprise 4 test cases on it\\'s own,So you add a test that covers the bug’s case, it fails. Then you keep running it as you troubleshoot? I started writing this comment to make fun of you, but that kind of makes sense.,For backend development at least you can\\'t really test the behavior without the structure. You wouldn\\'t even know what classes to test.,>\\tI don’t get the hate.\\n\\nMost methodology and technology complaints on this sub are from people who fundamentally misunderstand them and want to act like the ass-backwards way they see someone do it is the way everyone does it.,Even a lot of text books and even Wikipedia gets it wrong. Writing all tests for a feature and then starting to code production code ist not at all TDD and obviously stupid in almost all situations.,Not really though.\\n\\nWiki:\\n\\n> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on **software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed**, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.\\n\\nI think the classic narrative that TDD is when tests before code is the correct one and the one provided by the comment you replied to is the actual outlier.,I\\'m supposed to write a test first, but a test for what exactly?,ok so from what you say, I guess TDD is good when the interface already exists but not what goes around. So either you are writing a new micro service that interface with existing microservices, which sounds a good use case for TDD, but many of us never do that, or you are writing a code for both sides of the interface and you have 80% chance to discover that your interface was poorly designed because you didn\\'t understood the problem space enough, which is probably how most of us tried TDD.,Junior dev energy.,Hey, I wanted to start doing some of that :(,I only make them when I\\'m looking for a new job. Recruiters love that shit.,- Identify where & how bug happens\\n- Write test with those conditions\\n- Run test, assertion fails\\n- Change code,Well no, because lots of people reproduce the bug without writing a test. They do it manually.,I agree. We have one customer that insists on 100%. The usual workflow is: Develop new feature using TDD, the feature finishes with about 80% coverage. Then I spent some time writing tests to cover getters, setters and library methods. I hate it. Still better than untested code. Or code that is tested, but so badly, that the tests won\\'t discover bugs and prevent even the slightest refactorings.,Indeed!  I forgot about worst case.,There isn\\'t an obesity epidemic because people love broccoli,I mean, I like some veggies, but not more than other things, you know?,You can just as easily end up in the same position writing your tests after the code though.\\n\\nI feel like you are praising the idea of unit tests more than the idea of TDD here.,That\\'s a broad and useful definition of TDD that I\\'m not sure the evangelists would agree is TDD at all,When i say TDD is optional i dont mean writing unit tests is optional lol. Write them first, write them last, go back and forth......whatever works for you,Fully agree. Does it matter to you if your colleague writes class first and tests second or the other way around though?,I mean, setting up all the stuff needed to even run my code in a self contained test would take probably more than 1000 lines of code. And it\\'s not like it\\'s *my* project. I work on this with a couple hundred other people. Can\\'t just change the architecture of the whole thing because I don\\'t like it.,In my opinion if the test writer and the feature implementer are two different devs then it is duplicated effort because both of them needs to understand the feature in full. Maybe for critical systems this could be beneficial but usually there aren\\'t enough devs even without duplicated efforts.,The requirements should follow my code!,You have the right response (include TDD as part of estimate and don’t let PM or whoever influence your dev process), but you’re being a little dismissive. Of course professional environments have time pressure, and it would be dishonest to say that using TDD isn’t likely to take marginally longer than simply ignoring tests altogether or slapping together superficial tests at the end for appearances sake. I think it’s pretty fair to say that using TDD is a short term sacrifice made for long term gain.,What i mean is I have a vague idea of i want my module to do at a high level. But to write tests first im missing a ton of classes and other modules that are necessary to test. So i start writing, get something rough down. Then i write some tests for the smaller submodules, and refactor them. I reorganize, and test as I go.\\n\\nI do not say “I want to make an application that does this high level complex task”, then go and write high level tests. Because if i do, as soon as i realize my source code is no good i have to throw the tests away.,If you know who to code you can\\'t write bugs.,In my experience the kind of premature optimization you get from that practice is rarely worth it. With unlimited time and resources your approach works 100% of the time, but the real world has compromises and constantly shifting goalposts. At least that\\'s what I\\'ve had to deal with in my jobs.,Yeah that just doesn’t flow with the style I write. I agree with breaking it down into small pieces. But I’m not the type of programmer that can plan every single aspect of functionality before I write it. I like to try multiple approaches if necessary. I usually find what is right as I try things. Like I believe it’s possible to adjust to the TDD style, but I have a lot of success doing it the way I do it, so it doesn’t make sense to try and change my approach. \\n\\nI don’t think there is any one right way to write code IMO. TDD can flow for certain types of people, for me it has a time and place and will likely never be my primary approach. \\n\\nAs far as not testing things that are not your responsibility I totally agree. I do the stubbing approach as well, but I find that to be messy. I don’t have a better option tbh, I just know stubbing a ton feels wrong,But, since you\\'re writing tests based off of working code at that point, you\\'re not *really* doing TDD any longer, are you?\\n\\nBut I agree; any significant refactor, especially (partial) rewrites, really benefit from extensive testing.,I think every time I rewrote something, nobody wanted feature-parity with the old version. But yeah, it\\'s a great way to get feature parity.,This is legit the best way to do it.,At that point you can just check the new code\\'s output against the old code\\'s output, no need for separate tests.,Is it development tough?,Imagine if those shit load of tests already existed from the original development.,Most likely they don\\'t. \\n\\nEvery place I interviewed said essentially the same, but they all did tests after the fact and lots of their tests were Integration tests rather than actual unit tests.\\n\\nI\\'ve never worked in a heavily regulated industry, banking etc, so maybe there they do, but most places just don\\'t have the time or patience.,edit: The comment below was removed, good work everyone!,I wonder how they enforce it. If it\\'s in 1 commit they can\\'t see what you developed first. Does it mean they require the functionality to be developed by another dev than the test? So dev 1 has to write the test, complete a PR and than dev 2 creates the implementation?,[removed],Mistake. 99% chance the actual engineers there will say they know it\\'s in the dev plan that they don\\'t really follow.,Usually managers say this because they don\\'t actually know what\\'s going on,Well, I mean, TDD did die for our sins, so we should probably do it the way the prophet would have done it.,There’s the risk that “write tests after the code” can turn into “oops we don’t have time to write the tests and need to move on” versus the TDD case where testing is built directly into the development cycle so that you have tests ready to go when the feature is code-complete.\\n\\nThe other major advantage of TDD if you’re doing it right is that it stops you from retrofitting the tests to your existing code. When that happens defects can get converted into “features” because the code passes the tests that were written just to pass on the existing code in order to check a box saying you have tests. Instead it forces you to plan tests around desired functionality, then you write code to the planned spec and the tests validate you did so correctly.\\n\\nI’ve never worked anywhere doing anything like TDD and there are substitutes and workarounds to it but it has theoretical benefits if a team can be disciplined about it.,Problem I see is the main detractors of TDD are also the ones who aren\\'t good are writing any unit tests at all. So I prefer the aims and goals of what TDD tries to achieve as other ways can be corrupted a lot easier by those who just don\\'t want to write good tests.,Well said. I\\'d even go so far as to say it works for some situations and not others. When I\\'m parsing a protocol - heck yeah, tdd is great. I already know the  format for input - I captured it with wireshark. I already know the data structures and a bunch of constants - those are right out of the RFC. Why not whip up a test to see if parse() returns the right UdpHeader or whatever.\\n\\nWhen I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing? No thanks - I can\\'t write down how to validate the solution when I don\\'t know the solution, and likely don\\'t really even know the problem yet. I just need to get down in the code and play with it for a while. Fail a bunch, etc. \\n\\nBut the acolytes... ugh. I found it helps to know their lingo a bit. I had a colleague that wouldn\\'t shut up about test this and that every time I asked his opinion on what path was worth exploring in some system we were building. Turns out the magic words i needed were \"I\\'m throwing s spike to look at this idea\"  - once I started using the \"throwing a spike\" bit, it deactivated the \"code cannot exist before tests\" mode or something.,TDD in my experience is great for getting design feedback about the boundaries in your systems. So I guess the risk of test-after-development in these use cases is your boundaries can be hard to change when you’re finished if the tests suggest your design wasn’t right? More generally, I also think it’s important to get away from, “I need a new class, let’s start a new test suite!”, the “unit” in unit testing can be a whole heap of classes working together inside that boundary.,Same here. It almost sounds like we work at same place. Lol.,There is no shortage of things that would work in a perfect world.,The specification of a feature should not prescribe implementation detail. **Unit** tests should target minute implementation details as well.,\"Why did this change three times as long as you usually do it?\"\\n\\n\"I was doing TDD!\"\\n\\n\"Who gave you authorisation to do that? We have delivery deadlines, regulatory SLAs and you\\'ve spent all this time doing TDD?!\"\\n\\nTotally made up interaction, but essentially why quite often we can\\'t just do it and devil take the hindmost.,Your traditional definition doesnt align with my experiences. I\\'ve found it\\'s usually:\\n\\n- Write some outline of code first. Perhaps a function definition. \\n- figure out how to run that code. Maybe a Jupyter notebook, perhaps a command line tool, or a dedicated script. Perhaps running in the product itself works. \\n- iterate back and forth with writing the bulk of the code, while running it every once in a while. \\n- delete whatever method you used to run the code instead of committing it as a test.,Sure, but even a debug session requires running. For example, writing a new function or api endpoint. You still need inputs to call it. If you don\\'t throw away those inputs, you\\'ve done TDD.,Yeah, IMO the main benefit is: if the test is hard to write, the code should *most of the time* be different.\\n\\nI use TDD sometimes, but mainly as a design tool.,Obviously if I have to change the tests I\\'m doing it because the tests are wrong.. that doesn\\'t help any though, because I don\\'t know what the correct way of testing it is until I\\'ve already coded the project.\\n\\nI can see the value of designing tests *after* you\\'ve coded something so that in the future if you make changes it\\'s easy to see if your changes accidentally break something.. but the idea of designing tests before coding it makes no sense at all to me - figuring out exactly how I\\'m going to implement everything is like 99% of the work, I\\'m not going to know what I should be testing until I\\'m already basically finished with the task.,Why would extracting a method break your test? It should behave exactly the same before and after.,\"Have you tried putting the nuclear power plant fire out with gasoline?\",So a couple of things here. To your first point about not knowing what to expect when writing tests after the code, that is absolutely an argument to try and implement TDD. By writing the tests first and really just by approaching the code through the lens of small testable chunks, you can make sure you have thoroughly reasoned and tested code as the output \\n\\nBut perhaps more importantly to your second point about what if the tests are wrong. Unit tests can\\'t really be wrong unless they just aren\\'t testing what the code is doing. So if you\\'re worried the tests are wrong because it is difficult to write unit tests for it then that could potentially mean you should refactor your code into more discrete pieces that are easier to test. If you mean wrong as in it doesn\\'t match the functionality it was supposed to, that\\'s something you use other forms of testing for, like integration, systems, or acceptance tests.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit reductive, but unit tests can be kind of boiled down to flavors of given X the code does Y. Whether or not you actually get X or you want Y falls under a different layer of testing.,Not necessarily. I\\'ve seen people completely break behaviour and change tests to match.\\n\\nLike literal test named \"X should only execute once\" and pull request created which changed assertion to Times.Exactly(23)...,All my deadlines get set before any sort of requirements get hashed out.  At the end the business just makes a call to release a product without all features or to push the deadline to get more included.\\n\\nThe functional purpose of deadlines is to apply pressure to employees, being accurate isn\\'t really important for that purpose.,I prefer the term WAGILE, because it includes the word \"WAG\", like the Product team is wagging the Engineering team around.  \\n\\n\\nAlso if you say it in Waluigi\\'s voice, it is much more entertaining and you\\'ll smile to yourself as you crunch to meet that unrealistic deadline.,Isn\\'t that still a bad way to demo it because the impression it gives is how stupidly meticulous they are about things that could easily be manually tested?,Also, if you can automate the steps to reproduce, it’s so much easier to test possible fixes. Especially with complex systems,Exactly so. Also, when you\\'re done you have a test case that covers the specific case of this bug, meaning it won\\'t come back again when someone changes the code in the future.,You shouldnt care about testing classes. You should care about testing behavior,If you don\\'t know that, it\\'s probably a terrible idea to start writing the actual code.,I think of tests like logical proofs of application behavior. Because this assertion passes I know the app does XYZ. So if you don’t know what to test, then you don’t know what your application does. Ergo, go figure that out first because that is always step 1.\\n\\nOnce you know what your application does, you express that assertion in code. “When a user makes this type of request to X endpoint with these params, the response looks like Y” or “when this function is called with X argument, it returns Y”. Again if you don’t know that your application has an endpoint X that accepts XYZ params, or that it has a function A that’s requires an argument B, then you don’t know what your app does yet and you should figure that out first.\\n\\nI’m being obtuse about the whole process, it never goes as smoothly as I’m saying. But in my experience TDD has saved my ass way more than it has gotten in my way. Also RE “figuring out what your app does”, I think it’s totally legit to write code prior to the tests for prototyping, but I will literally comment it out or just delete it then write tests and add it back to see that feedback of the step of going from failing tests to passing tests. It’s kind of a fundamentals thing at times, something I do all the time for the 10% where it really matters. But I truly believe in it strongly for just about everywhere it is practical to use.,behavior not yet implemented,>I\\'m supposed to write a test first, but a test for what exactly?\\n\\nIf you\\'re doing some sort of R&D where you have nothing but the vaguest idea of what you\\'re doing or how, then TDD isn\\'t all that great.\\n\\nBut a lot of the time you do know what the result will be, and then it can be useful. You start by writing a test for the most basic part of the function, and when that test passes, you add tests for whatever variations in the logic might happen.\\n\\nSay that you need to write a function that multiplies two numbers with each other and returns the result. Except if any number is a 3, it throws an error. Also, any negative numbers should be treated as positive.\\n\\nFirst you just write a test that checks that \"(2,5) == 10\". When that test passes, you write a test that checks that \"(2,3) == error\", that will fail. Add the logic that makes it pass.\\n\\nThen you write a test that checks that \"(-1,2) == 2\", which will fail. Then you add logic that lets the test pass.\\n\\nEtc.,I\\'ve read some posts from senior devs. They\\'re usually very detailed about a specific weakness and a solution they used, and potential solutions discussed. They\\'re above the \"Fix everything with this one wierd trick!\" clickbait bs,My point was that normal human behavior has the same principle as tdd (reproduce bug == write test down).,Yea, so manually testing it. Still testing,TDD is a design tool before it’s a risk-mitigation tool. Testing to reach all the internal guts of a system that’s probably using mocks quickly becomes problematic. Some bits of code are so simple + static, they’re not worth covering. Add to that the fact you can get 100% code coverage without writing any asserts, it’s not a great metric to drive the process with. (Mutation testing OTOH has always interested me lots),legacy code is for sure difficult to improve. but all things being equal TDD is still the wat to go,[deleted],When you’re going to write a test that calls into some class you haven’t written yet, at that point you know:\\n- you have a discrete piece of functionality that you want to encapsulate in a class\\n- you are imagining some sort of interface that allows you to retrieve some data or something\\n\\nInstead of writing that class, just create an empty shell with the single method you want to call with no implementation, and then in your test stub the implementation to whatever is relevant to your test case. Basically just make up whatever you need to finish the part you are working on and write yourself a todo. So if you know you’re going to need a function that takes an ID of something, does some arbitrary business stuff, and then returns the ID of some other related object, you don’t need to code out/test all that business logic right now, just create a class with the method that will eventually do that, and then in your tests stub the method to provide whatever return value you need for the test case you’re working on. When you actually write that class your job is simple because you don’t need to think about how it will work you just need to implement what you said you would. Yes, sometimes you get this wrong and realize you envisioned a bad interface and need to change the architecture and tests, but that’s a skill and you’re not going to build it unless you practice.\\n\\nI will get off my soap box now, I don’t mean to preach so much. I guess I discovered today that I’m passionate about TDD 🤷\\u200d♂️ definitely better in theory than practice as most everything is, but it’s an ideal I definitely aspire to.,That statement makes me believe you don\\'t actually code... or build anything else for that matter.,My experience is largely working with somewhat mature code bases that I wish had much more test coverage 😂 half my job right now is adding tests I think should have been there from the start, so that obviously colors my experience. I suppose the more my work resembles “prototyping” the more code I tend to write before adding tests, but in general I’ve been working to introduce tests as soon as possible in my dev process. I am fully open to changing my mind in the future, but right now I would call myself a big TDD fan based on my experience saving my own ass with tests I’ve written. Just last week I hit something where I was like 99% chance that bug would have made it to production had I not written this test.,I consider anything that writes tests first as TDD, but I don\\'t really fret about what these kinds of things are named.,Wrap that prod code in a fluffy blanket of tests before making change.,It\\'s TDR, test driven refactor,Yea it has happened to me once in 20 years :p,I did one of these recently. We were migrating code from the appserver to the server, so as part of it, I wrote a bunch of tests of the UI. Got them all passing, flipped the switch on the migration, and then dealt with the fallout.,Imagine world peace.,As some someone who works in banking and has to deal with a shit ton of regulations and auditing, I would absolutely assure you that we are at least as much of a total clusterfuck as where you work.,I work in aerospace and we mainly use integration tests, combined with a half-implemented unit test suite. So even when building rockets we’re not really using TDD lol,It was some fintech startup.,I work in automotive. We do tests after like everyone else. In fact our dev and test team are actually entirely separate. Our focus is usually on black box integration testing using HIL rigs anyway and those tests are developed from the spec rather than the implementation. \\n\\nUnit and module level integration testing is then back filled towards the end of the project.,As a dev in the financial industry... you are wrong if you think the code is regulated. It\\'s duct tape all the way down.,This!,[removed],Anywhere with a regulatory framework will do full requirements and testing so TDD is superfluous. Code and test are done in parallel and bugs get fixed if they don\\'t match up.,Good bot,You can\\'t exactly enforce TDD, but you can enforce the result that you want if you do TDD: very good test coverage and code that is easier to test and maintain. That is to say, writing a spaghetti code mile long piece of code that still manages to have tests probably wouldn\\'t be accepted.,No idea. Require tests to be reviewed and committed before code is written? Close monitoring of all developers?,I watched one video once advocating for TDD, and in the example, the requirements for the code were quite clear. He took the first requirement and wrote a test, ran the test against blank code (so it failed), then wrote the code so it passed.\\n\\nThe stupid part was you could see immediately from the test + code he wrote it violated another one of the requirements (cause the requirements were nuanced).\\n\\nI watched in horror as he continued this process of writing tests, watching them immediately fail and write new code until he hit one requirement that contradicted most of what he had written thus far and then he basically proceeded to delete and/or rewrite most of his test code and code to accommodate the new requirement. I was mortified at the process.,All the more reason not to work there.,>TDD case where testing is built directly into the development cycle so that you have tests ready to go when the feature is code-complete.\\n\\nCan\\'t you just have the same result by having test and implementation done in parallel? \\n\\nFrom my limited experience it works really nicely since there\\'s a separation where tests don\\'t get influenced by implementation and vice-versa (at least initially) by having 2+ people do it in parallel. Basically covers the advantage of your 2nd paragraph.,My big issue is that doing red / green / refactor doesn’t always fit my workflow. Sometimes I know what I want to build but not the exact shape it’s going to take and want to quickly put down code and see how things work / feel in different ways then build on it. Writing tests first doesn’t help with that. \\n\\nIf I’m altering behaviour of something existing or I have a solid plan of what I’m going to make then sure tests first might make sense, but I just don’t think it has to be like that to be well written code.,This is it! I’m a big TDD fan even though I don’t stick to the discipline 100% of the time. Pretty much every anti-TDD person I’ve worked with was plain bad at testing and at designing code that others people could contribute to easily.\\n\\nThere may be No Silver Bullet but there are a **WHOLE LOT** of werewolves out here slinging needlessly bad code.,>I\\'d even go so far as to say it works for some situations and not others\\n\\nYup. That\\'s the key thing ~~assholes~~ acolytes¹ of **any** flavor can\\'t seem to wrap their minds around: The world isn\\'t black and white, and your (development paradigm, design paradigm, code editor, theme, language, etc), no matter how ideal for you, may not be ideal for me, or for every situation I find myself in. Or even every situation **you** find yourself in, except that you are so stuck in it, you can\\'t see it.\\n\\n\\n>But the acolytes... ugh. I found it helps to know their lingo a bit. ... \"I\\'m throwing a spike to look at this idea\"\\n\\nOK, first thank you for figuring out the secret incantation to shut these particular people up! I will be filing that away for future use.\\n\\nAnd second, why TF is it always on the reasonable people to learn how to talk to the unreasonable people in ways they will listen to, and not the other way around? I mean I know why, it\\'s right there in the sentence. But I\\'m pretty damn sick of it.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n¹leaving \"assholes\" there because autocorrect gave it to me instead of \"acolytes\", and, well ...,Right, so an ideal setting (like a classroom) is a great example where TDD works perfectly. Someone who\\'s already solved the problem can tell you exactly the sorts of tests you need to write in advance, which makes the actual solution significantly easier.\\n\\nLeetcode questions are essentially TDD as well,Hum... Unit tests *should not* target implementation details.\\n\\nThe fact that they often do is a problem, that people willingly create to trade off for other larger problems, but it\\'s not desirable by itself.,Your experience doesn\\'t define how TDD works.\\n\\n>* Write a test that *fails*\\n>* Write just enough code to make the test *pass*\\n>* Refactor\\n\\nThis is the core workflow of TDD. If you don\\'t do it, you\\'re not doing TDD.,That\\'s a way of developing, and probably something most devs do to some extent, but it\\'s not TDD, as it has a pretty clear definition of those 3 steps.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have a *test* first, your development is not *driven by test*. Even if you run your code every now and then, it\\'s not *test driven*.,Lol. I guess technically you\\'re correct, which is the best type of correct. But my schemas usually change so much I rarely do automated tests like that till the end.,Unless you have a repl :-),Sometimes the tests are hard to write because the framework your company uses is shit and you can\\'t really do anything about it,The point is that your tests shouldn\\'t depend on how you implement it. Your tests should encode what you want your implementation to do, but not how you want it to do it. To me, starting there makes sense: I usually don\\'t know how my code is going to work, but I always know what I want it to do, so starting with the bit that I know for sure seems like a good idea.\\n\\nFor example, if I\\'m implementing a stack, I don\\'t know whether I want to use an array or a linked list or some other exotic data structure, but I do know that if I push an item and then pop the stack, I should get the same item back. I might also know that I want to be able to push and pop a million items in under a millisecond. If I have a test and a benchmark set up, I can experiment with whatever implementation I can think of and know that it meets my requirements if the tests are green.,Because the logic is extracted to a new class and a dependency is injected into the original. So your old tests now doesn’t correctly mock the returned result of the new method and new class.,You need HNO3 to oxidize uranium, so setting it on fire is quite hard.,Unit tests can totally be wrong for other reasons.\\n\\nIf you\\'re writing something which is meant to be a simulation which behaves like reality, then \"right\" is determined by what happens in reality, and what you wrote in the code is completely irrelevant. If it fails, then it isn\\'t the test which is wrong, it\\'s the code.,Yeah, usually happens for classes with way too much responsibility, so both the class itself and the unit test is impossible to read/understand without spending a week.\\n\\nAlso, some devs just seem to not give a fuck.,Well, usually they either have the tests already written, or they\\'ve given the demo so many times that they can write them in no time at all. Either way (like in most of these types of demos) the practical considerations are glossed over, while the speaker is praising the system to the moon, leaving most with a positive impression.\\n\\nIt\\'s not just TDD, pretty much any demo of a business process is like that. Ultimately, these process coaches are salesmen, they want to get you excited about it so that you sign up for more sessions, or recommend them to your colleagues. Whether or not it plays out in reality is besides the point, long as they milked you for plenty of coaching sessions,Haha this exactly, gotta know what you want the code to do FIRST before writing code,> Say that you need to write a function that multiplies two numbers with each other and returns the result.\\n\\nHow do you even get to this point? I understand writing a test first and adding cases for a pure function like this. Given a reasonably sized task with a handful of high level acceptance criteria and/or user stories. To get down to small functions like that, there\\'s some design work that needs to be done to figure out what the smallest functions will do and how they fit together. Or do you just write a test for the first acceptance criterion and implement 75% of the logic just to get that to pass?\\n\\nI tend to code in an explorative manner, tinkering little bits of logic and public interfaces and eventually they meet up and I make it all work. Without tests I\\'m free to refactor much faster, then adding tests to nail down certain parts that should be checked and shouldn\\'t change. TDD is a very different approach and there\\'s more to learn than just \"code after test\".,Yeah, and they also place value on knowledge sharing (not just consuming). Actively disdaining that is a poor attitude.,hardcore senior dev blog posts can have some of the coolest shit, even though a lot of them are fundamentally just in-depth solutions to wonky edge cases,But reproducing a bug is not the same as writing the test down. Far from everyone “uses” TDD for bugfixes.,That’s not TDD.,Many of these concerns are addressed in the BDD concept. I personally try to develop like that. Great explanation video: [https://youtu.be/zYj70EsD7uI](https://youtu.be/zYj70EsD7uI),I can get behind this idea for long term in-house development where maintainability is key. Although I fear that some devs would just brute force tasks with tiral and error and leave it be as soon as all tests passed. And good luck convincing an external client on a greenfield project to do any kind of testing in the first place.,I work FAANG :\\\\^),Pretty sure that guy is on /s.,Yeah working exclusively on legacy definitely makes you wish for tests. I\\'ve been on both ends of the spectrum so I understand the desire. When I did T3 support TDD was a godsend cause we needed to prevent future regressions, but now I work on more new product development and it\\'s just not realistic to define all the functionality at the stage we\\'re at... and then we never write tests 😂,If it\\'s too long of a test refactor, does it become a TLDR?,Thanks for this term, sounds like what I want to be doing but instead of writing real tests, I just execute parts of code and compare (my code mostly deals with APIs, so I\\'d have to mock a looot to make real tests...),LOL...I get your point. High test coverage is difficult, for sure, but it\\'s much more easily attainable than world peace. I have worked on projects with 90% test coverage. It\\'s great when failing tests warn you that you broke something while you are working on it rather than a months later when a user finds a bug in production.,\"Why is it converting from USD to account numbers?\",As another dev in banking, I can double assure that I\\'m as much as a hack as everyone else as well.,Then they most definitely were not ahah,Then, probably they do. Why did you decline? Unit testing is almost zen mediation 🤭,[removed],No, TDD works for **some problems** and not for others (just like unit tests, but that\\'s whole another discussion)\\n\\nIf your problem is non-trivial, can clearly define an interface and expected behaviour which doesn\\'t consist of side effects, then TDD works perfectly.\\n\\nMind that this basically means - if your code code is purely functional, then TDD works perfectly.\\n\\nAnother case is - if setting up real environment for debugging is too bothersome, then TDD can be great development tool by providing you fake environment to develop and debug in (I love using this for developing code analysis in Roslyn),I\\'d like to see the velocity of that. New features released once an astronomical season.,So your secret is to always see all of the requirements coming and to write the entire program correctly in a single pass? Shoot, if I could do that I wouldn’t need TDD either.,Can\\'t argue with that. I\\'m still working on my interview questions to determine if the managers know what\\'s going on. Until then I have to assume I\\'m being duped by everyone so I might as well stay with the devil I know.,If you want to write a prototype without tests so you can figure out a problem that’s totally reasonable. Best to do that in a standalone minimal example program so as to easily prove out your idea.\\n\\nThen work the good parts of your prototype into your *actual* program. You may as well TDD for that last step now that you know where you’re going and all.,Amen!,From a specification perspective even how you break up your code into functions or how you structure your classes is an implementation detail.\\n\\nUnit tests are to test the smallest possible unit (isolated function or method).,Agreed. My argument isn\\'t that devs are doing TDD; my argument is that many of them are doing something remarkably similar, but then deleting their quick tests instead of putting them in a test suite. \\n\\nTDD isn\\'t that different from how many devs just operate naturally. To be clear, it is definitely different, but not that different. At least for me, where I\\'ve never successfully written a feature without running it frequently.,True. I totally agree that it\\'s not TDD. I\\'m just always just surprised when developers dump on TDD and then proceed to use an adhoc process that\\'s remarkably similar. Obviously not everyone does this, but it\\'s common enough. I\\'ve even worked with developers who have a collection of quick tests and command line utilities that allow them to run various parts of the code, but they don\\'t check any if it in. So close to helping new devs understand the codebase, but just missing that critical step.,Yes, but usually it’s the exception rather than the rule.\\n\\nShould you have an abstract layer above the interaction with the framework to make it easier? Should each piece have less responsibility? Etc…\\n\\nI am not saying that TDD is some holy grail here, but I think it’s smart to ask those questions if the design feels messy. TDD is a great tool to discover those potential design flaws as early as possible.,Write wrappers around the difficult to encapsulate concepts, write tests for those wrappers for validation, and now you can use your wrappers confidently everywhere else and stub those calls in your tests because you’ve verified the wrapper is handling all the framework interactions as desired.\\n\\nEasier said than done obviously, but if you ever have something that’s hard to test then IMO the code is telling you that you have another class or function to extract somewhere. It’s not really complex implementations that are hard to test, it’s highly variable outcomes where the result could be one of many branches depending on the situation. When that is the case, refactor each branch into its own testable function and then you just test the main function by verifying that it calls the right helper function in a given circumstance. Rinse and repeat until it’s unit tests all the way down and now you can work in your code base with confidence.,Sure, I know what the end goal of the code is, but it needs to be split into a ton of smaller functions and those smaller functions all need tests too, and I don\\'t know exactly what all those smaller functions should do until I\\'ve already done most of the work.,But if you know you’re going to extract the function into a class or method then you likely already know what that method is going to return. So your test is not broken, you just haven’t updated it yet, which you know that you must do and how you must do it because you just made an architecture decision.,I like that this was one of the answers,Sadly, it was the latter,It doesn\\'t happen, ever. Just like correctly implemented TDD,You hit the nail on the head with it’s more than just “test first, code after”. In my experience you are forced to write the code differently so that it is testable. This feels odd when you’re used to not doing so, and feels inefficient because you intuitively and correctly know that code doesn’t need to be testable to be good or to work.\\n\\nBut there is value in a solid test suite, and if you want to do TDD well you need to think about your code in terms of the boundaries of interfaces and plan your development accordingly. This is the big reason to write tests first IMO, because in order to write the tests first you need to answer these design questions. And it is very possible to do this without exploring first, but it takes practice.\\n\\nLastly, you said that you have a hard time seeing how the code fits together until you have explored some, and while I get that frustration, I think you might be approaching TDD with the wrong mental model if that’s your hangup. People are usually referring to the usage of unit tests when they talk about TDD, which are about the function of a specific class, function, etc, not concerned with how different classes/functions interact with one another. If you’re a carpenter and you go buy a pack of screws, you don’t go home and test what kind of load they will bear before using them, you trust what the manufacturer says for the most part. That screw’s behavior has been pre-verified, and you can use it for it’s intended behaviors with confidence that it will perform as expected. This is what you’re aiming for with TDD, a file tree full of screws and other tools with highly verified behavior that you can compose  as desired. You should be thinking in terms of what each piece of code will be responsible for, ironing out those boundaries, and then verifying that each piece of code performs its intended function via your test suite, so that when these pieces are composed you can be more confident in the result.,If you work in a codebase or environment where you really need to do explorative development or R&D or something like that, then no, TDD isn\\'t the best. If you work in some sort of ugly legacy code, it may not even be entirely feasible all the time, or at all.\\n\\nIf I need to do that, I usually don\\'t write tests while figuring stuff out. But when I get back to refactoring to make the final actually good version that\\'s easy to maintain, I\\'ll typically do some TDD for that.\\n\\nTypically if we get a high level user story, we\\'ll work with the product owners or other stakeholders to break it down into smaller pieces of work so that we actually have an idea of what needs to be done. I\\'m not talking going all waterfall on it, just to know enough details to create a first iteration.\\n\\n>then adding tests to nail down certain parts that should be checked and shouldn\\'t change\\n\\nAlso, while it can certainly be helpful to have tests to make sure that no one changes code they shouldn\\'t (although in that case they might just change the tests as well), it\\'s also extremely helpful to have tests for the code that *will* change. If you have unit tests, you know that code that move, be reorganised or refactored much more easily with more confidence that nothing broke. You only need to change the tests if the requirements change.\\n\\nIn my experience, you save a lot of time in the long run with that.,It is — it’s your verification of a particular behavior. You wouldn’t know that the bug is happening if you did not reproduce the bug, just as you would not know that the test is failing without writing the test. The trick is making the test accurately represent the bug, but once you do then it is captured forever in code rather than some text on a jira ticket listing the steps to reproduce, and your CI tool can run the test before you deploy to ensure you didn’t accidentally reintroduce the bad behavior, instead of you building up a whole list of interactions to manually test in staging before deploying to prod or something like this.,It’s not strictly TDD, but roughly follows the same process. That’s why they said “”uses”” and not “uses”.,Sure you do...,When you graduate from maintaining legacy code to writing it 💪🏽😅,haha yea just being snarky, I love test coverage, but I find just getting the team to write non-shit tests at all is the first hurdle ;),And how come my account number only has 3 digits 😤,Unit testing is great.\\n\\nTDD is not.,TDD can be used in i/o but you have to have your i/o fully designed when you start out, and that\\'s rarely the case. The people consuming your days are usually waiting for you to decide what days your code will be delivering to them...,Well the initial requirements were there in easy to read bullet point form. All he had to do before starting the work was to read all of the bullet points. This guy\\'s example wasn\\'t about using TDD to adjust your code in the future because the requirements had changed. This video was TDD every minute step of the way and they were advocating for this process.,> and those smaller functions all need tests too\\n\\nThis is, I think, where people tend to go wrong when they read about TDD and then try it.\\n\\nThey assume you write tests the same excessively pedantic way people tend to write them after the fact.\\n\\nJust write the critical subset of tests needed to verify the intended behavior is being implemented. That gets you most of the value with a small fraction of the work.,IMO no, those smaller functions don\\'t need tests unless they are an exposed part of a public interface. The tests you write should be intended to survive all refractors that don\\'t change functionality intact. Writing a test for something is like a live, enforced doc of: this is how my app must behave. Why do that for anything that isn\\'t a requirement of your app to function in the real world?\\n\\nIf you have test cases for everything you want your public interface to be able to do, all the branches in all the small functions should be covered by those tests, otherwise those small functions have unreachable code,Those smaller functions *dont need tests*. Its entirely redundant since your primary functionality wont work without them. Thats your problem, you are overdoing the testsing. Its waste.,Red Green bud. Red is broken. The test is broken until you make it green.,In the past year, I\\'ve started writing my code differently to be more testable but I still can\\'t see how TDD fits in. I\\'m taking a few bits from it to incorporate into my own style but that\\'s as far as I\\'ll go now.,>  If you have unit tests, you know that code that move, be reorganised or refactored much more easily with more confidence that nothing broke.

Cause that would be Larry\\'s code and we should ask him.,But have you heard of our lord and savior, BDD?,The problem is people try TDD when they\\'re writing tests in general wrong.\\n\\nToo many people test for implementation rather than for behaviour. Rather than specify \"how is public interface supposed to behave\" they code \"nothing about this class can ever change without tests failing\"\\n\\nThey can\\'t separate \"what do you want to accomplish\" and \"how do you accomplish that\",Then I really don\\'t get the point of it - the whole point of tests is to break it up into smaller parts so that you can ensure that each part of it is working properly.. if you aren\\'t breaking it into smaller parts then\\n\\nA) for a lot of projects it will be way too complicated to be viable to test it in the first place - there are just too many possible combinations to test all of them when you don\\'t know whether the functions it\\'s using are working or not \\n\\nB) If something goes wrong then you still won\\'t have any clue where the problem is \\n\\nand C) There may be a lot of cases where it isn\\'t obvious what the output of a test should be - for instance, if there\\'s any kind of randomness or if the output will depend on some other API/database etc..\\n\\nTo me that\\'s like going through all the effort of testing without getting any of the benefits of it. Imagine trying to test something like a search engine like that - how on earth am I supposed to write tests to see if a website is working 100% properly just by sending requests to it? How do I know whether getting 0 results is because there are actually 0 results or because of a bug? The website is the only exposed part of it.. but it\\'s way too damn complicated to even think about writing a test just for that one part of it without splitting it up into smaller problems.,I’d argue that there’s a difference between a non-passing test and a test that is not passing because it does not accurately model your application’s behavior. For the former you should change your implementation so that the test passes, and for the latter you should change the test because it would lead you to write incorrect code to satisfy an erroneous assertion. So making an architecture decision and changing your tests to reflect the new architecture is just part of the process of changing your architecture over time, which hopefully you’re not doing a ton.,And you can definitely do that while writing TDD as well.,Bug Driven Development?,I see myself in this picture and I don\\'t like it.,> the whole point of tests is to break it up into smaller parts so that you can ensure that each part of it is working properly..\\n\\nTo me it\\'s more to have a living document that specifies exactly how my program must behave, that complains when my program doesn\\'t do what it\\'s supposed to\\n\\n> for a lot of projects it will be way too complicated to be viable to test it in the first place - there are just too many possible combinations to test all of them when you don\\'t know whether the functions it\\'s using are working or not\\n\\nAre the requirements too complicated to describe? I suppose I don\\'t understand how this is possible.  There is a bit of an art to writing efficient tests where you need to create the world in order to verify an interaction between components, but I think well made factories can solve that problem in a maintainable way.\\n\\n> If something goes wrong then you still won\\'t have any clue where the problem is\\n\\nWith the time I save on not writing tests that aren\\'t requirements, I  suppose I can afford to take a tiny bit longer finding where my bugs are using a dedicated tool like a debugger (which is often faster to start with anyway IMO)\\n\\n>  There may be a lot of cases where it isn\\'t obvious what the output of a test should be - for instance, if there\\'s any kind of randomness or if the output will depend on some other API/database etc..\\n\\nWell, that\\'s why your test says: \"When the API responds like this I do that\".  People hate on ruby but [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) makes it very nice to mock/stub that, or for python there\\'s [responses](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23914464).  For the database you can use a local database with factories to easily create the data you need for each test and clear it between tests.,The point of tests is to make sure that the code meets requirements not to break it up into manageable pieces. That is a design problem.\\n\\nA) you should be testing exposed public functions on expected case, expected error states, and edge cases. Every possible input is not needed and the function should have a clear expected result\\n\\nB) you will have a better idea where something went wrong and can use a debugger to narrow it down\\n\\nC) you should be mocking external request responses to random libraries api\\'s etc so that the test will run identically every time\\n\\nFor example I was recently testing a function for an app I wrote. The application fetched a response from an API, manipulated the data, and put some results into the database. The test utilized a static response from a mocked API call ran the function and mocked the database so no actual inserts were going in. The test verified that the database functions were being called the appropriate number of times with the appropriate parameters. Testing for the database was done separately as well as the API calls against a schema. This allowed me to verify that the function was doing what I expected it to without relying on a consistent response from an external server and without relying on any specific database implementation. When all three of these components passed thier individual tests I can assume that it will all work in conjunction. This larger function however called two private functions to improve readability of the code, but the two private functions were not directly tested because if the primary function gives expected results than the private functions are working properly. If it wasn\\'t I could run the test in debug mode to determine where exactly the source of error came in.\\n\\nYour conflating public functions with user exposure. A public function can be called outside the direct class it doesn\\'t mean that the user necessarily sees it. In my example the DB has public functions for insert/remove/search but the user is never allowed to directly say they want to do any of these things. My code decides based upon the API calls what must be insert/removed the user only says they want an API fetch.,>Then I really don\\'t get the point of it - the whole point of tests is to break it up into smaller parts so that you can ensure that each part of it is working properly.. if you aren\\'t breaking it into smaller parts then\\n\\nNo it\\'s not. The point is to test a specification that with an input you have an output. You can have test that pass through multiple components. This is very useful when you have some actual logic, not just API calls.\\n\\n>To me that\\'s like going through all the effort of testing without getting any of the benefits of it. Imagine trying to test something like a search engine like that - how on earth am I supposed to write tests to see if a website is working 100% properly just by sending requests to it? \\n\\nYou are confusing things here probably. You should test your own logic. If you call an API and with the response you have to do some logic, then you test only the logic with a fake api response. So you make sure that your logic is correct. If you just pass the information without any transformation then you so not need any test. And about the database, you own the db, you can startup a docker container and fill it with the data you need. No randomness here.,It doesn’t matter how you describe a test that fails. That misses the point entirely.\\n\\nThe point is. TDD sucks because you have to write tests before you have an underlying implementation completed. Which forces you to refactor tests over and over as you flesh out your design.,Yes, but it\\'s slower and less enjoyable.,Balls-to-this Don\\'t Develop. It involves [taking up work on a farm shovelling pig shit and administering anal suppositories to sick horses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs),Why not delegate specification and requirements analysis to the userbase.

All I want is to say to the test - every time that you create e a new object that handles the connection to the db, just return true - I am not testing the connection to the db, I just want to test that the \"write to db\" was called with values A, B and C.\\n\\nWith T-SQLt is dead easy. But does not work for C#.\\n\\nI do see that you should only test the public methods for the behaviour,  but how should I test that when a request is made, that the private method that gets written do the db gets called?! Once the new keyword is used, it won\\'t work.\\n\\n\"Use interfaces?!\" Why should I have to code more just so it can be tested?\\n\\nBit of a rant but still curious in how to make it work.\\n\\nThanks,You didn’t read what I said. You don’t change the test when it’s not passing, you change the code. The only reason you would need to change the tests is if you need to change the overall architecture of the system, not the implementation of a particular method. Decide how it will work at a high level first, write tests for those high level expectations, then write the implementations that satisfy the tests. The tests only change if the high level expectations change, but those shouldn’t change very often. If you can’t nail down those high level expectations yet then sure do some prototyping, but once you go to start doing the real work then you switch to writing tests first. Your exploration is about figuring out how to build a testable system, not building the system and figuring out how to test it afterwards. Once you know how to build that testable system, you write the tests and then go back to filling in the implementation. That doesn’t suck, it saves your sanity by letting you be confident about the work you’ve done.,It\\'s only slower before you\\'ve gotten used to it. Afterwards, it tends to go faster, because you\\'re more sure that your code works as intended, and you discover and prevent more errors during development, rather than afterwards.,You got any openings?,> For instance the writing to a file or the connection to a dB. All I want is to say to the test - every time that you create e a new object that handles the connection to the db, just return true - I am not testing the connection to the db, I just want to test that the \"write to db\" was called with values A, B and C.\\n\\nI\\'d be asking myself \"how does the user of my app know when this function has completed?\" There exists a world where even changing the database used by the private methods didn\\'t break the tests, nor changing the interface of those methods, but that the database connection was still tested.  To do that you would need to test using the public interface for verification as well.  Detecting that a private method was called with certain arguments isn\\'t a resilient test. \"When I save these changes to a user, the next time I look up the user by ID, those fields will be set.\"  \"When I attempt to save a valid user, I get a successful response containing the timestamp at which the user was updated.\"  These are tests you could write against a library or API that would survive the user storage backend being completely recreated, all private methods being renamed, and yet still verify the functionality of your app.  You don\\'t need to stub the method that writes to the database, or aka dependency inject a mock database service implementing the DB interface in some languages, you just need a local test database to use for your tests.  I use `docker compose` at work to make it super easy to set these up in both development and CI pipelines.,Do you have any tricks for having tons of tests that all hit the database without them walking over each other?\\n\\nIE maybe you have tests that involve creating/deleting individual rows in a table, and another test that performs an aggregate on that table. Tests running concurrently will interfere with each other, and running tests sequentially is slooow,Well on the bright side you will have fewer tests doing this. But they will be a *lot* slower hitting even a local DB, especially if you have a complicated schema and any test might end up creating many objects, associations, and transitive associations in just a few lines of factory code.  Where I work we have even slower integration tests that have to provision resources on a remote kubernetes cluster in order to succeed, now those are slow.  But I do think they\\'ve saved time in the long run!\\n\\nYou can still run concurrent tests against a DB, there are just gotchas associated with that.  One way, with an RDBMS and depending on how you provision connections, you could start a transaction before each test and roll it back at the end - other transactions wouldn\\'t be able to see the deletes etc. until it\\'s applied.\\n\\nOf course you\\'ll never get to use this with a NoSQL DB (or many ORMs, or if your methods make use of transactions themselves), then you have to ensure your test data doesn\\'t collide by naming things differently (factories can make this not too hard).  When you\\'re aggregating a column you filter on the data you created for that test.\\n\\nBut it\\'s definitely a cost of this approach that even with fewer tests, they\\'ll probably run a lot slower than if you explicitly mock all dependencies.  Using factories like I\\'m recommending compounds this way further than fixtures (preexisting/seeded test resources that you verify API calls with) since certain branches will be called repeatedly in test after test just in creating and recreating the test data.  IMO the clarity of factories vs fixtures is worth it, and the time saved refactoring tests is as well.  Normally only the CI runs the full test suite unless someone is making some major changes.'"

      "\n",
      "Second if you do test, but after the code is done, here are a few disadvantage that you probably noticed:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Not so fun, you know it work (see above)\n",
      "* Code might not be testable\n",
      "* Refactoring to make it testable seems\n",
      "   * risky since there are no tests to prove you won't break anything (lack of confidence)\n",
      "      * As a matter of fact : How many time have you heard \"it works now don't touch anything\"\n",
      "   * futile since you know it work and you might then decide to not tests everything and that leaves holes in the tests suite, reducing the trust in it.\n",
      "* If you tried to make it testable from the start there are probably way to much interface and abstractions. And you might end up in mocking hell.\n",
      "* Tests done after are often more akin to characterization tests, that is they explain what the implementation does instead of how is should behave.\n",
      "* could go on...\n",
      "\n",
      "As for test first:\n",
      "\n",
      "* More fun, kinda like a game, make a test, make it pass, high five peers\n",
      "* Code is testable by default\n",
      "* Refactoring is easier, if you break anything you know immediately\n",
      "* When done correctly interfaces and abstractions are mostly limited to architectural boundaries.\n",
      "* Test suite represent the specs of the project (how is should behave)\n",
      "   * A project can be recreated from it's spec alone, but the spec can't be recreated from production code, at best you can characterize it, describe what it does not what it should do\n",
      "* Little to no debugging. Everything worked a minute ago, finding the problem you created in the meantime should be pretty simple.\n",
      "* It's an iterative process, always ready to commit. It's not all there, but every implemented spec is done and tested at all time, maybe it just handle the value '3', but if higher up want to deploy it now, they can\n",
      "* could also go on...\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps you notice there is some kind of \"directionality\" to it, going from spec to behavior, from tests to code, that don't work very well the other way around. This is where lie the strength of TDD I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't have to believe me, but I would invite you give it a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course keep in mind it's not a perfect technique and don't think it aim to resolve every problems in the world, it doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just know that like most programming technique, TDD requires some getting used to until it becomes more \"natural\". Usually a programmer would need to do it full time for about 4 to 6 month or part time consistently for about a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "And eventually you will have done all your mistakes and will then know what to do and not to do.\n",

      "Unfortunately, most people who try it don't get there and often complain about things that usually resolve themselves once you get a better gist of it. There are also a lot of fan of TDD trying to explain it who are not there yet neither and end up making the technique look bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "A frequent mistake people make is to think you need a class of test for every class of production code. It's wrong and only lead to fragile tests which is a frequent complain (\"tests breaks every time I make a change\"). Lots and lots of workplaces do it, but you can't fulfill the purpose of automated tests if your tests break every time you rename or move a class or a method.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A class of test for every class of production code\" come from books and blog posts whose examples are generally too simple. When all the examples you see always test a single class then it certainly looks like that's what you should do. But actually that technique is more akin to micro-tests, which can be useful while working on a feature, but is mostly useless and unmaintainable in a test suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proper unit tests would mostly focus on the inputs and outputs of the facade of your project, of the public entry points, while using test doubles for architectural boundaries (inputs and outputs include parameters and returned values, but also data getaways, which send data to or receive data from outside the architectural boundaries). Public entry points could still be a single class, say if you're doing a math or a collection library, where almost everything would be public, but that is not the case of most libraries or apis where public entry points would be pretty limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, since this is getting pretty long I'll conclude with this. A successful test suite should act like a client to production code and be decoupled from it. Production code should be decoupled from it's architectural boundaries. And if you have to remember only one thing it should be that as tests become more specific, the production code should become more generic (so they really can't be 1:1), it should help render whatever the type of test you decide to make easier to maintain.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've been on a few teams that have tried to implement actual TDD and it just never goes well. In order for TDD to even be possible, you have to have your entire interface planned out before you write a single line of code, which just isn't how most human beings write software.\n",

Professional situations being one, and open source projects being another. The primary reason that communication between developers and a shared understanding of the interfaces available is key to success in these situations. In this case tests are a contract about application behavior that declare to other devs how the application should behave. All the devs involved need to agree about how the application should behave in a given situation, and test cases are great way to codify that. Then we don’t need a shared understanding of the entire application, we just need to agree that the tests must pass before we can merge or deploy.

Plus, a lot of times the test drivers aren't there yet until there's a known design used in the application, since we have to emulate a lot of hardware stuff. It's definitely a best practice code smell to not have that all in place first.,Pivotal Labs. TDD, along with pair programming, was like a religion there.

Still testing,TDD is a design tool before it’s a risk-mitigation tool. Testing to reach all the internal guts of a system that’s probably using mocks quickly becomes problematic. Some bits of code are so simple + static, they’re not worth covering. Add to that the fact you can get 100% code coverage without writing any asserts, it’s not a great metric to drive the process with. (Mutation testing OTOH has always interested me lots),legacy code is for sure difficult to improve. but all things being equal TDD is still the wat to go,[deleted],When you’re going to write a test that calls into some class you haven’t written yet, at that point you know:\n",
      "- you have a discrete piece of functionality that you want to encapsulate in a class\n",
      "- you are imagining some sort of interface that allows you to retrieve some data or something\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of writing that class, just create an empty shell with the single method you want to call with no implementation, and then in your test stub the implementation to whatever is relevant to your test case. Basically just make up whatever you need to finish the part you are working on and write yourself a todo. So if you know you’re going to need a function that takes an ID of something, does some arbitrary business stuff, and then returns the ID of some other related object, you don’t need to code out/test all that business logic right now, just create a class with the method that will eventually do that, and then in your tests stub the method to provide whatever return value you need for the test case you’re working on. When you actually write that class your job is simple because you don’t need to think about how it will work you just need to implement what you said you would.

      "Easier said than done obviously, but if you ever have something that’s hard to test then IMO the code is telling you that you have another class or function to extract somewhere. It’s not really complex implementations that are hard to test, it’s highly variable outcomes where the result could be one of many branches depending on the situation. When that is the case, refactor each branch into its own testable function and then you just test the main function by verifying that it calls the right helper function in a given circumstance. Rinse and repeat until it’s unit tests all the way down and now you can work in your code base with confidence.,Sure, I know what the end goal of the code is, but it needs to be split into a ton of smaller functions and those smaller functions all need tests too, and I don't know exactly what all those smaller functions should do until I've already done most of the work.,But if you know you’re going to extract the function into a class or method then you likely already know what that method is going to return. So your test is not broken, you just haven’t updated it yet, which you know that you must do and how you must do it because you just made an architecture decision.,I like that this was one of the answers,Sadly, it was the latter,It doesn't happen, ever. Just like correctly implemented TDD,You hit the nail on the head with it’s more than just “test first, code after”. In my experience you are forced to write the code differently so that it is testable. This feels odd when you’re used to not doing so, and feels inefficient because you intuitively and correctly know that code doesn’t need to be testable to be good or to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is value in a solid test suite, and if you want to do TDD well you need to think about your code in terms of the boundaries of interfaces and plan your development accordingly.

And it is very possible to do this without exploring first, but it takes practice.\n",

      "Lastly, you said that you have a hard time seeing how the code fits together until you have explored some, and while I get that frustration, I think you might be approaching TDD with the wrong mental model if that’s your hangup. People are usually referring to the usage of unit tests when they talk about TDD, which are about the function of a specific class, function, etc, not concerned with how different classes/functions interact with one another. If you’re a carpenter and you go buy a pack of screws, you don’t go home and test what kind of load they will bear before using them, you trust what the manufacturer says for the most part. That screw’s behavior has been pre-verified, and you can use it for it’s intended behaviors with confidence that it will perform as expected. This is what you’re aiming for with TDD, a file tree full of screws and other tools with highly verified behavior that you can compose  as desired. You should be thinking in terms of what each piece of code will be responsible for, ironing out those boundaries, and then verifying that each piece of code performs its intended function via your test suite, so that when these pieces are composed you can be more confident in the result.,If you work in a codebase or environment where you really need to do explorative development or R&D or something like that, then no, TDD isn't the best.

The trick is making the test accurately represent the bug, but once you do then it is captured forever in code rather than some text on a jira ticket listing the steps to reproduce, and your CI tool can run the test before you deploy to ensure you didn’t accidentally reintroduce the bad behavior, instead of you building up a whole list of interactions to manually test in staging before deploying to prod or something like this.,It’s not strictly TDD, but roughly follows the same process.

The website is the only exposed part of it.. but it's way too damn complicated to even think about writing a test just for that one part of it without splitting it up into smaller problems.,I’d argue that there’s a difference between a non-passing test and a test that is not passing because it does not accurately model your application’s behavior. For the former you should change your implementation so that the test passes, and for the latter you should change the test because it would lead you to write incorrect code to satisfy an erroneous assertion. So making an architecture decision and changing your tests to reflect the new architecture is just part of the process of changing your architecture over time, which hopefully you’re not doing a ton.,And you can definitely do that while writing TDD as well.,Bug Driven Development?,I see myself in this picture and I don't like it.,> the whole point of tests is to break it up into smaller parts so that you can ensure that each part of it is working properly..\n",

      "> for a lot of projects it will be way too complicated to be viable to test it in the first place - there are just too many possible combinations to test all of them when you don't know whether the functions it's using are working or not\n",
      "\n",
      "Are the requirements too complicated to describe? I suppose I don't understand how this is possible.  There is a bit of an art to writing efficient tests where you need to create the world in order to verify an interaction between components, but I think well made factories can solve that problem in a maintainable way.\n",
      "\n",
      "> If something goes wrong then you still won't have any clue where the problem is\n",
      "\n",
      "With the time I save on not writing tests that aren't requirements, I  suppose I can afford to take a tiny bit longer finding where my bugs are using a dedicated tool like a debugger (which is often faster to start with anyway IMO)\n",
      "\n",
      ">  There may be a lot of cases where it isn't obvious what the output of a test should be - for instance, if there's any kind of randomness or if the output will depend on some other API/database etc..\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that's why your test says: \"When the API responds like this I do that\".  People hate on ruby but [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) makes it very nice to mock/stub that, or for python there's [responses](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23914464).  For the database you can use a local database with factories to easily create the data you need for each test and clear it between tests.,The point of tests is to make sure that the code meets requirements not to break it up into manageable pieces. That is a design problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "A) you should be testing exposed public functions on expected case, expected error states, and edge cases. Every possible input is not needed and the function should have a clear expected result\n",
      "\n",
      "B) you will have a better idea where something went wrong and can use a debugger to narrow it down\n",
      "\n",
      "C) you should be mocking external request responses to random libraries api's etc so that the test will run identically every time\n",
      "\n",
      "For example I was recently testing a function for an app I wrote. The application fetched a response from an API, manipulated the data, and put some results into the database. The test utilized a static response from a mocked API call ran the function and mocked the database so no actual inserts were going in. The test verified that the database functions were being called the appropriate number of times with the appropriate parameters. Testing for the database was done separately as well as the API calls against a schema. This allowed me to verify that the function was doing what I expected it to without relying on a consistent response from an external server and without relying on any specific database implementation. When all three of these components passed thier individual tests I can assume that it will all work in conjunction. This larger function however called two private functions to improve readability of the code, but the two private functions were not directly tested because if the primary function gives expected results than the private functions are working properly. If it wasn't I could run the test in debug mode to determine where exactly the source of error came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your conflating public functions with user exposure. A public function can be called outside the direct class it doesn't mean that the user necessarily sees it. In my example the DB has public functions for insert/remove/search but the user is never allowed to directly say they want to do any of these things. My code decides based upon the API calls what must be insert/removed the user only says they want an API fetch.,>Then I really don't get the point of it - the whole point of tests is to break it up into smaller parts so that you can ensure that each part of it is working properly.. if you aren't breaking it into smaller parts then\n",
      "\n",
      "No it's not. The point is to test a specification that with an input you have an output. You can have test that pass through multiple components. This is very useful when you have some actual logic, not just API calls.\n",
      "\n",
      ">To me that's like going through all the effort of testing without getting any of the benefits of it. Imagine trying to test something like a search engine like that - how on earth am I supposed to write tests to see if a website is working 100% properly just by sending requests to it? \n",
      "\n",
      "You are confusing things here probably. You should test your own logic. If you call an API and with the response you have to do some logic, then you test only the logic with a fake api response. So you make sure that your logic is correct. If you just pass the information without any transformation then you so not need any test. And about the database, you own the db, you can startup a docker container and fill it with the data you need. No randomness here.,It doesn’t matter how you describe a test that fails. That misses the point entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point is. TDD sucks because you have to write tests before you have an underlying implementation completed.

      "Thanks,You didn’t read what I said. You don’t change the test when it’s not passing, you change the code. The only reason you would need to change the tests is if you need to change the overall architecture of the system, not the implementation of a particular method. Decide how it will work at a high level first, write tests for those high level expectations, then write the implementations that satisfy the tests. The tests only change if the high level expectations change, but those shouldn’t change very often. If you can’t nail down those high level expectations yet then sure do some prototyping, but once you go to start doing the real work then you switch to writing tests first. Your exploration is about figuring out how to build a testable system, not building the system and figuring out how to test it afterwards. Once you know how to build that testable system, you write the tests and then go back to filling in the implementation. That doesn’t suck, it saves your sanity by letting you be confident about the work you’ve done.,It's only slower before you've gotten used to it. Afterwards, it tends to go faster, because you're more sure that your code works as intended, and you discover and prevent more errors during development, rather than afterwards.,You got any openings?,> For instance the writing to a file or the connection to a dB. All I want is to say to the test - every time that you create e a new object that handles the connection to the db, just return true - I am not testing the connection to the db, I just want to test that the \"write to db\" was called with values A, B and C.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd be asking myself \"how does the user of my app know when this function has completed?\" There exists a world where even changing the database used by the private methods didn't break the tests, nor changing the interface of those methods, but that the database connection was still tested.  To do that you would need to test using the public interface for verification as well.  Detecting that a private method was called with certain arguments isn't a resilient test. \"When I save these changes to a user, the next time I look up the user by ID, those fields will be set.\"  \"When I attempt to save a valid user, I get a successful response containing the timestamp at which the user was updated.\"  These are tests you could write against a library or API that would survive the user storage backend being completely recreated, all private methods being renamed, and yet still verify the functionality of your app.  You don't need to stub the method that writes to the database, or aka dependency inject a mock database service implementing the DB interface in some languages, you just need a local test database to use for your tests.  I use `docker compose` at work to make it super easy to set these up in both development and CI pipelines.,Do you have any tricks for having tons of tests that all hit the database without them walking over each other?\n",
      "\n",
      "IE maybe you have tests that involve creating/deleting individual rows in a table, and another test that performs an aggregate on that table. Tests running concurrently will interfere with each other, and running tests sequentially is slooow,Well on the bright side you will have fewer tests doing this. But they will be a *lot* slower hitting even a local DB, especially if you have a complicated schema and any test might end up creating many objects, associations, and transitive associations in just a few lines of factory code.  Where I work we have even slower integration tests that have to provision resources on a remote kubernetes cluster in order to succeed, now those are slow.  But I do think they've saved time in the long run!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can still run concurrent tests against a DB, there are just gotchas associated with that.  One way, with an RDBMS and depending on how you provision connections, you could start a transaction before each test and roll it back at the end - other transactions wouldn't be able to see the deletes etc. until it's applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course you'll never get to use this with a NoSQL DB (or many ORMs, or if your methods make use of transactions themselves), then you have to ensure your test data doesn't collide by naming things differently (factories can make this not too hard).  When you're aggregating a column you filter on the data you created for that test.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's definitely a cost of this approach that even with fewer tests, they'll probably run a lot slower than if you explicitly mock all dependencies.  Using factories like I'm recommending compounds this way further than fixtures (preexisting/seeded test resources that you verify API calls with) since certain branches will be called repeatedly in test after test just in creating and recreating the test data.  IMO the clarity of factories vs fixtures is worth it, and the time saved refactoring tests is as well.  Normally only the CI runs the full test suite unless someone is making some major changes.\n"

      "   * futile since you know it work and you might then decide to not tests everything and that leaves holes in the tests suite, reducing the trust in it.\n",
      "* If you tried to make it testable from the start there are probably way to much interface and abstractions. And you might end up in mocking hell.\n",

      "   * A project can be recreated from it's spec alone, but the spec can't be recreated from production code, at best you can characterize it, describe what it does not what it should do\n",

      "\n",
      "A frequent mistake people make is to think you need a class of test for every class of production code. It's wrong and only lead to fragile tests which is a frequent complain (\"tests breaks every time I make a change\"). Lots and lots of workplaces do it, but you can't fulfill the purpose of automated tests if your tests break every time you rename or move a class or a method.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A class of test for every class of production code\" come from books and blog posts whose examples are generally too simple. When all the examples you see always test a single class then it certainly looks like that's what you should do. But actually that technique is more akin to micro-tests, which can be useful while working on a feature, but is mostly useless and unmaintainable in a test suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proper unit tests would mostly focus on the inputs and outputs of the facade of your project, of the public entry points, while using test doubles for architectural boundaries (inputs and outputs include parameters and returned values, but also data getaways, which send data to or receive data from outside the architectural boundaries). Public entry points could still be a single class, say if you're doing a math or a collection library, where almost everything would be public, but that is not the case of most libraries or apis where public entry points would be pretty limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, since this is getting pretty long I'll conclude with this. A successful test suite should act like a client to production code and be decoupled from it. Production code should be decoupled from it's architectural boundaries. And if you have to remember only one thing it should be that as tests become more specific, the production code should become more generic (so they really can't be 1:1), it should help render whatever the type of test you decide to make easier to maintain.\n",

In this case tests are a contract about application behavior that declare to other devs how the application should behave. All the devs involved need to agree about how the application should behave in a given situation, and test cases are great way to codify that. Then we don’t need a shared understanding of the entire application, we just need to agree that the tests must pass before we can merge or deploy. That way you can write your feature and I can write mine, and if we ever need to work on one another’s down the line we can be confident that we won’t break it because we will ensure it still passes the tests the other wrote to define its behavior.

The test verified that the database functions were being called the appropriate number of times with the appropriate parameters. Testing for the database was done separately as well as the API calls against a schema. This allowed me to verify that the function was doing what I expected it to without relying on a consistent response from an external server and without relying on any specific database implementation. When all three of these components passed thier individual tests I can assume that it will all work in conjunction.

If it wasn't I could run the test in debug mode to determine where exactly the source of error came in.\n",

      "Your conflating public functions with user exposure. A public function can be called outside the direct class it doesn't mean that the user necessarily sees it. In my example the DB has public functions for insert/remove/search but the user is never allowed to directly say they want to do any of these things. My code decides based upon the API calls what must be insert/removed the user only says they want an API fetch.\n",

      "You are confusing things here probably. You should test your own logic. If you call an API and with the response you have to do some logic, then you test only the logic with a fake api response. So you make sure that your logic is correct. If you just pass the information without any transformation then you so not need any test. And about the database, you own the db, you can startup a docker container and fill it with the data you need. No randomness here.\n",

      "You didn’t read what I said. You don’t change the test when it’s not passing, you change the code. The only reason you would need to change the tests is if you need to change the overall architecture of the system, not the implementation of a particular method. Decide how it will work at a high level first, write tests for those high level expectations, then write the implementations that satisfy the tests. The tests only change if the high level expectations change, but those shouldn’t change very often. If you can’t nail down those high level expectations yet then sure do some prototyping, but once you go to start doing the real work then you switch to writing tests first. Your exploration is about figuring out how to build a testable system, not building the system and figuring out how to test it afterwards. Once you know how to build that testable system, you write the tests and then go back to filling in the implementation. That doesn’t suck, it saves your sanity by letting you be confident about the work you’ve done.\n",

      "I'd be asking myself \"how does the user of my app know when this function has completed?\" There exists a world where even changing the database used by the private methods didn't break the tests, nor changing the interface of those methods, but that the database connection was still tested.  To do that you would need to test using the public interface for verification as well.  Detecting that a private method was called with certain arguments isn't a resilient test. \"When I save these changes to a user, the next time I look up the user by ID, those fields will be set.\"  \"When I attempt to save a valid user, I get a successful response containing the timestamp at which the user was updated.\"  These are tests you could write against a library or API that would survive the user storage backend being completely recreated, all private methods being renamed, and yet still verify the functionality of your app.  You don't need to stub the method that writes to the database, or aka dependency inject a mock database service implementing the DB interface in some languages, you just need a local test database to use for your tests.  I use `docker compose` at work to make it super easy to set these up in both development and CI pipelines.\n",

      "Well on the bright side you will have fewer tests doing this. But they will be a *lot* slower hitting even a local DB, especially if you have a complicated schema and any test might end up creating many objects, associations, and transitive associations in just a few lines of factory code.  Where I work we have even slower integration tests that have to provision resources on a remote kubernetes cluster in order to succeed, now those are slow.  But I do think they've saved time in the long run!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can still run concurrent tests against a DB, there are just gotchas associated with that.  One way, with an RDBMS and depending on how you provision connections, you could start a transaction before each test and roll it back at the end - other transactions wouldn't be able to see the deletes etc. until it's applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course you'll never get to use this with a NoSQL DB (or many ORMs, or if your methods make use of transactions themselves), then you have to ensure your test data doesn't collide by naming things differently (factories can make this not too hard).  When you're aggregating a column you filter on the data you created for that test.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's definitely a cost of this approach that even with fewer tests, they'll probably run a lot slower than if you explicitly mock all dependencies.  Using factories like I'm recommending compounds this way further than fixtures (preexisting/seeded test resources that you verify API calls with) since certain branches will be called repeatedly in test after test just in creating and recreating the test data.  IMO the clarity of factories vs fixtures is worth it, and the time saved refactoring tests is as well.  Normally only the CI runs the full test suite unless someone is making some major changes.\n",
